Liberating</a>Originally

<p>The OSCON <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/keynotes.html#thu">Thursday
Keynotes</a>
had the following speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conference Announcements - Nat Torkington, Conference Chair,
O&#8217;Reilly Media, Inc.</li>
<li>TCP/IP and Shipping Containers - Nick Gall, MetaGroup</li>
<li>High Order Bit: Secrets Behind Ruby on Rails - David Heinemeier
Hansson, 37Signals</li>
<li>Enterprise IT: Open Source Powerhouse - Kartik Subbarao, HP</li>
<li>Computational Origami: From Flapping Birds to Space Telescopes -
Robert Lang</li>
<li>Interview: Mitchell Baker - Mitchell Baker, Mozilla Foundation</li>
<li>Identity 2.0 - Dick Hardt, Sxip Identity</li>
</ul>


<p>Below are my notes from the keynotes (notes from keynotes? sounds
redundant) Nick Gall was up first with a short 15 minute presentation
comparing TCP/IP packets to 20 ton shipping containers. His argument was
that the invention of the shipping container in 1956 (I think) spurred
the global economy (and globalization) because it was flexible (you
didn&#8217;t have to open the container except at origination and destination
and various vehicles could handle the containers over sea and land). The
standards/protocols that we use in the internet enable new uses not
thought of when originally developed. After that DHH was up with a quick
talk about the Secrets Behind Ruby on Rails. No real secrets here, first
he explained that RoR is an integrated stack of web-app frameworks
written in Ruby. Accordingly, RoR is interesting because it follows
convention over configuration (works for most people, most of the time),
changes are instant (no XML situps, no recompiling, relaunching &#8211; just
a simple refresh of the browser), finally RoR ships as a complete,
integrated and familiar stack using a single language (Ruby). Some
choice quotes: &#8220;Use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it&#8221;,
&#8220;Flexibility is overrated&#8221; and &#8220;Constraints are Liberating&#8221;. Following
DHH came Kartik from HP &#8211; I originally thought this was going to be yet
another marketing keynote, but thankfully it wasn&#8217;t too bad. He compared
open source to the ocean (water) with its ability to flow into the
cracks (helping enterprises glue together their important IT
infrastructure). He compared the closed source world to a desert (earth)
in need of water. He then compared those who take OSS but don&#8217;t give
back to a swamp (when all the water comes in and none leaves that&#8217;s what
you get), finally he said the perfect compromise is Venice, Italy a city
built upon the earth but surrounded (and throught, due to canals) by
water. Kartik was certainly enthusiastic, but I was glad he only had 15
minutes. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/2218">Robert
Lang</a> was
next &#8211; he didn&#8217;t seem to fit from the conference notes, so I was
curious why he was invited to speak. But I was pleasantly surprised. His
talk was about the art of origami (paper folding, without cutting it)
and how it has evolved and within the last 20 years or so has really
exploded due to the use of computers to mathematically model the paper
folding, allowing some never-before Origami tricks (like making insects
or fish with 400+ scales). He also mentioned that NASA used these
techniques for folding up a lens so it would fit on the space shuttle.
You should really check out his <a href="http://www.langorigami.com/">work</a>, it
is amazing. The penultimate keynote was simply an interview of Mitchell
Baker from the Mozilla Foundation by Nat. I&#8217;m sorry, but I was totally
uninterested so you&#8217;ll have to look elsewhere for the details of that
interview. Finally, Dick Hardt from <a href="http://www.sxip.com/">Sxip</a>
(pronounced skip) gave a talk on Identity 2.0 &#8211; I had thought this was
going to be another marketing attempt for his company, but even though
it did push his company and take some digs at the competition, his
presentation style was amazing and engaging &#8211; when it was done, I
wanted to watch it again. It was rapid fire a few words or picture(s)
per slide running through slides amazingly quickly (about one per
second, though he paused at times). Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like
Sxip has a Ruby library yet for their Identity 2.0 SDK (actually, I
couldn&#8217;t find it on their redesigned site &#8211; last time I went there I
found a PHP version). Finally, PG put up his talk from Tuesday night on
his website: http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html And, is anyone
else, who&#8217;s a first time OSCON attendee (and travelling to Oregon for
the first time) wondering what Tillamook and Multnomah are? I finally
looked them up in the wikipedia: Evidently Tillamook is a county in
Oregon named after the Native American Tillamook tribe. Multnomah is
also a county in Oregon named after the Native American tribe of
Chinookan people.</p>
