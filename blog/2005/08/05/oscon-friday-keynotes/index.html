<div class="entry-content"><p>The OSCON <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/keynotes.html#fri">Friday
Keynotes</a>
are over and here are my notes. To save folks some trouble (in case none
of these people interest them), I&#8217;ve listed the speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conference Announcements - Nat Torkington, O&#8217;Reilly Media, Inc.</li>
<li>Linux - In Search of the Desktop - Asa Dotzler, Mozilla Foundation</li>
<li>Open Source Biology - Drew Endy, MIT Biological Engineering</li>
<li>Open Source Licensing Issues - Tony Gaughan, Computer Associates</li>
<li>On Evil - Danny O&#8217;Brien, Need To Know</li>
<li>Howtoons - Saul Griffith, Squid Labs</li>
</ul>


<p>And the afternoon closing session was keynoted by Miguel de Icaza. The
first speaker was Asa Dotzler from the Mozilla Foundation regarding his
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/008499.html">controversial
post</a> that
Linux is not ready for the desktop and what the Linux developer
community needs to do to get it there. In general, I agree with Asa&#8217;s
points regarding Linux &#8211; but I think it is largely irrelevant (or will
be) now that all of the interesting applications are moving on to the
web &#8211; pretty soon folks won&#8217;t care what OS their machines are running
as long as the browser works (perhaps Linux on the desktop will
eventually win &#8211; but as a cut down, minimal OS that runs on the
cheapest commodity hardware and simply boots quickly into a full-screen
browser). Next was Drew Endy and Assoc. Prof at MIT Biological
Engineering. His presentation on DNA as the code for writing/building
biological organisms was quite good. It seems that they are also dealing
with difficult patent issues in his field as well because as companies
discover which strings of DNA-code do what, they immediately patent the
work. He gave the example of students who made an organism which
essentially took photographs (the billions of bacteria would rearrange
themselves to reproduce the image shone onto them) &#8211; this was only
possible because the building blocks necessary for this project were
freely given to them by the various universities which own the patents
on them. Following Drew was Tony Gaughan from Computer Associates, at
first I thought this was going to be another marketing keynote, this
time for CA&#8217;s Ingress open source database. While Tony did mention
Ingress quite a bit he also went over the open source licenses which
have been written in the last few years and how this &#8220;explosion&#8221; of
licenses is not sustainable, fractures the open source community and in
general makes this very difficult for commercial interests who wish to
use and contribute back to open source projects. I completely agree with
this and think that the OSI needs to do something about it. If they can
boil down the essence of each of the existing licenses and build up a
sort-of template library of licenses where-by developers could simply
use one or more templates to licenses their software. Danny O&#8217;Brien, the
editor of Need To Know (and now apparently affiliated with the EFF) gave
a hilarous talk on &#8220;evil&#8221;. I can&#8217;t really do a good job of conveying it
since you really had to be there. Finally, what I thought was the most
interesting talk came from Saul Griffith of <a href="http://www.squid-labs.com/">Squid
Labs</a>. He spoke about the
<a href="http://www.howtoons.org/">HowToons</a> comics which his company is
developing (there are plans for a book as well) to get kids interested
in science and engineering (and let them have a lot of fun while doing
it) as well as the <a href="http://www.ifabricate.com/">iFabricate</a> document and
collaboration system for helping people share projects with one another
in a standardized way. He then showed videos of some of the projects
they have implemented with kids. For afternoon closing session, Miguel
de Icaza (of Novell) spoke about Linux on the desktop and the work at
Novell to completely replace MS Office with OpenOffice (done) and
replace MS Windows with Linux (50% done). He spoke about the portable
usability testing lab they have to watch how Windows users deal with the
migration to Linux (this information is passed back to the Linux/GNOME
developers). He then gave a demo of the forth-coming OpenSuSe Linux
distribution with a completely re-written UI layer that is &#8220;quartz-like&#8221;
in that it renders to PDF using OpenGL (hardware or software emulation).
The demo was really neat, he could change desktops by simply dragging
the desktop around (as it was really a cube), he show how quickly moving
windows made them wobble (like Jello), he showed an Expose-like feature
which unstacked the windows so you could find what you&#8217;re looking for
and he showed a video playing that was moved halfway between desktops &#8211;
so that when he tried to switch to the next desktop the movie window
bent around the corner of the cube (and it still played fine). ISOs for
this should be available sometime next week, he said. Overall, it was an
interesting tcchnology demo &#8211; not much new was said. Since I&#8217;ve got to
go to the airport, I&#8217;ll post my OSCON observations and thoughts on the
trends of software development over the weekend. I had a great time at
OSCON and hope to come back next year.</p>
