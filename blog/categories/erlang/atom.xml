    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> says, "The best reason to
learn a new programming language is to learn to think differently." Here
in Northern VA, we have a new opportunity to think differently with the
introduction of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">NoVA Languages
group</a>. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voodootikigod">Chris
Williams</a> from <a href="http://www.iterativedesigns.com/">Iterative
Designs</a> posted to the <a href="http://novarug.org/">NoVA
RUG</a> mailing list this morning and received quite a
bit of interest. Here's what he has to say about the new group:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thoughts on the makeup of the group include obtaining (however you
want) a book, working through the book 1 chapter per week on one night
of that week with a group of like minded individuals.</p></blockquote>

<p>To start, the group will work through Joe Armstrong's <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang">Programming
Erlang</a> book
starting on Monday, June 16th (hopefully I'll be able to work out a
schedule with my wife so I can attend). This is an excellent choice on
several levels: every developer should know a functional programming
language; single core processors are increasingly rare and the number of
cores in commodity hardware should only increase in the coming years;
and I already own the book.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> doesn't pique your interest, the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nscodernightdc">NSCoderNight DC</a> group
is going to work through the 3rd Edition of <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Aaron
Hillegass's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS
X</a>
book on Tuesday nights. For several months now, I've been playing around
with Cocoa and while I'm getting used to the syntax of Objective-C, the
XCode IDE and Interface Builder still seem foreign to me (I never liked
IDEs having been weened on Emacs).</p>

<p>It's a great time to be a programmer in Northern Virginia!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out that there's another Cocoa group right around
the corner from me in Reston:
<a href="http://www.cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads</a>.
They meet the second Thursday of each month.</p>

I've been looking for a good introductory book on
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> for quite awhile now. Unfortunately,
the Concurrent Programming in Erlang book just doesn't do it for me
(plus only the first part is available online). Thankfully, it looks
like the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> have
come through with <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html">Programming
Erlang</a>.</p>
