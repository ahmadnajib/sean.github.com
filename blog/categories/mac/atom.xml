    <id>http://seanmountcastle.com/blog/2008/06/12/inaugural-cocoaheads-reston-meeting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight the first <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads Reston</a> meeting was held at <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/index.html">Near Infinity Corporation</a>. <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/">Jason Harwig</a> gave an excellent presentation on <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>, starting with a simple browser created completely in Interface Builder (it consisted of a text field linked to a web view). I&rsquo;ve recreated it and included a snapshot below.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/basicbrowser.png" title="An Extremely Basic Web Browser" ></p>

<p>Next he demonstrated how to interact with the DOM and JavaScript. The JavaScript integration was in both directions, first he demonstrated calling JavaScript functions from Objective-C and then calling Objective-C from JavaScript. It should be noted that for JavaScript to call Objective-C you need to implement the <code>+ (BOOL)isSelectorExcludedFromWebScript:(SEL)aSelector;</code> method and return <code>NO</code> for each of the methods you wish to call.</p>

<p>Finally, Jason walked through various uses of WebKit an demonstrated an application specific, full-screen browser he wrote for a game as well as a del.icio.us Cocoa application he wrote called <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/delish/site/">Delish</a>. Several other webkit based applications were also covered such as <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> &ndash; a freely available site-specific browser creator, <a href="http://infinitenil.com/packrat/">PackRat</a> &ndash; a commercial site-specific browser for Backpack, and another application which I&rsquo;ve forgotten (I guess I should&rsquo;ve taken notes). As an aside, Jason brought up the interesting work that the <a href="http://280north.com/">280North</a> folks have done for their <a href="http://280slides.com/">280Slides</a> web-based presentation called <a href="http://objective-j.org/">Objective-J</a>. Objective-J (code named Cappuccino), is an Objective-C like language built on JavaScript.</p>

<p>Matt Wizeman stepped up next to demo a WebKit application he&rsquo;s developing to wrap a troublesome time tracking web application. It was interesting the machinations he had to go through to know when the page had finished loading and to transition between pages since the application was JavaScript heavy, using tricks like clickable divs.</p>

<p>I learned quite a bit about WebKit. As soon as I got home I was energized to play with it.</p>

<p>Be sure to come to the next meeting on July 10th (day before iPhone 3G day)!</p>

    <updated>2008-06-04T23:10:20-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://seanmountcastle.com/blog/2008/06/04/learn-a-new-programming-language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> says, &ldquo;The best reason to
learn a new programming language is to learn to think differently.&rdquo; Here
in Northern VA, we have a new opportunity to think differently with the
introduction of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">NoVA Languages
group</a>. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voodootikigod">Chris
Williams</a> from <a href="http://www.iterativedesigns.com/">Iterative
Designs</a> posted to the <a href="http://novarug.org/">NoVA
RUG</a> mailing list this morning and received quite a
bit of interest. Here&rsquo;s what he has to say about the new group:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thoughts on the makeup of the group include obtaining (however you
want) a book, working through the book 1 chapter per week on one night
of that week with a group of like minded individuals.</p></blockquote>

<p>To start, the group will work through Joe Armstrong&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang">Programming
Erlang</a> book
starting on Monday, June 16th (hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to work out a
schedule with my wife so I can attend). This is an excellent choice on
several levels: every developer should know a functional programming
language; single core processors are increasingly rare and the number of
cores in commodity hardware should only increase in the coming years;
and I already own the book.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> doesn&rsquo;t pique your interest, the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nscodernightdc">NSCoderNight DC</a> group
is going to work through the 3rd Edition of <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Aaron
Hillegass&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS
X</a>
book on Tuesday nights. For several months now, I&rsquo;ve been playing around
with Cocoa and while I&rsquo;m getting used to the syntax of Objective-C, the
XCode IDE and Interface Builder still seem foreign to me (I never liked
IDEs having been weened on Emacs).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great time to be a programmer in Northern Virginia!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out that there&rsquo;s another Cocoa group right around
the corner from me in Reston:
<a href="http://www.cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads</a>.
They meet the second Thursday of each month.</p>

    <id>http://seanmountcastle.com/blog/2007/11/27/a-tasty-treat-for-your-mac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The folks over at <a href="http://www.aquafadas.com/">Aquafadas</a> are running a
promotion entitled, &ldquo;<a href="http://givegoodfoodtoyourmac.com/">Give Good Food to Your
Mac.</a>&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a very sweet deal as you
get to choose from 28 different Mac OS X apps and the more you purchase
the bigger the discount. If you purchase three apps, you get a 30%
discount, 40% for five, 50% for seven and 70% for ten.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little hint, pick the five apps you really want (even if they
are the most expensive apps available). This will start you off with a
40% discount for the apps you want. Then pick the two cheapest apps &mdash;
once this brings your discount up to 50%, the total will probably be
less than it was without those two apps (unless you&rsquo;ve only been
choosing the cheapest apps). Finally, pick the next three cheapest apps
&mdash; you should end up with ten apps for a total cost which was less than
price of your original five! You&rsquo;re getting the five apps you want, plus
another five free and then they&rsquo;ll throw in another app at check out
(for me it was <a href="http://www.coladia.com/postino/">Postino</a>, a feed reader
&mdash; I&rsquo;m not sure if they give the same bonus app away to everyone or
not).</p>

<p>This great deal is time limited and ends on December 9th, so get on over
<a href="http://www.givegoodfood2yourmac.com/kitchen34/index.php">there</a> and

    <updated>2005-06-29T03:31:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://seanmountcastle.com/blog/2005/06/29/itunes-adds-support-for-podcasting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/podcasting/" title="Apple - iTunes - Podcasting"><img src="http://images.apple.com/podcasting/images/indexpodcasting1find20050628.jpg" alt="Apple iTunes
Podcasting" /></a>
<a href="http://www.apple.com/podcasting/">Apple &ndash; iTunes &ndash; Podcasting</a>
As expected, Apple has released a new version of iTunes which supports
<a href="http://www.apple.com/podcasting/">Podcasting</a>. The integration into
iTunes is great and, unfortunately for <a href="http://www.odeo.com">ODEO</a>, I
prefer it to the alternatives since I don&rsquo;t have duplicate Podcasts
sitting around on my disk now (well, atleast I don&rsquo;t have to manually
remove them). I will say that, currently, ODEO seems to have a better
selection of what Apple is calling &lsquo;Indie&rsquo; Podcasts &mdash; but I&rsquo;m sure that
will change as more folks register with Apple to have their PodCasts
added to iTunes. Tangentially, this morning while working out I was
listening to the <a href="http://www.dailysourcecode.com">DSC</a> and heard that
the <a href="http://www.castblaster.com">CastBlaster</a> beta is available for
download. So I rushed to the website and found out it&rsquo;s only available
for Windows. Ugh! Fortunately, it looks like Apple is pushing
<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/garageband/podcasts/">GarageBand</a> as a
Podcast recording studio. I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but perhaps over the
weekend I&rsquo;ll experiment with recording a Podcast. I haven&rsquo;t the faintest
idea as to what I&rsquo;ll speak about though.</p>
