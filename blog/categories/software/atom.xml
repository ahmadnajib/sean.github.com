    <id>http://sean.github.com/blog/2008/06/12/inaugural-cocoaheads-reston-meeting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight the first <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads Reston</a> meeting was held at <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/index.html">Near Infinity Corporation</a>. <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/">Jason Harwig</a> gave an excellent presentation on <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>, starting with a simple browser created completely in Interface Builder (it consisted of a text field linked to a web view). I've recreated it and included a snapshot below.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/basicbrowser.png" title="An Extremely Basic Web Browser" ></p>

<p>Next he demonstrated how to interact with the DOM and JavaScript. The JavaScript integration was in both directions, first he demonstrated calling JavaScript functions from Objective-C and then calling Objective-C from JavaScript. It should be noted that for JavaScript to call Objective-C you need to implement the <code>+ (BOOL)isSelectorExcludedFromWebScript:(SEL)aSelector;</code> method and return <code>NO</code> for each of the methods you wish to call.</p>

<p>Finally, Jason walked through various uses of WebKit an demonstrated an application specific, full-screen browser he wrote for a game as well as a del.icio.us Cocoa application he wrote called <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/delish/site/">Delish</a>. Several other webkit based applications were also covered such as <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> - a freely available site-specific browser creator, <a href="http://infinitenil.com/packrat/">PackRat</a> - a commercial site-specific browser for Backpack, and another application which I've forgotten (I guess I should've taken notes). As an aside, Jason brought up the interesting work that the <a href="http://280north.com/">280North</a> folks have done for their <a href="http://280slides.com/">280Slides</a> web-based presentation called <a href="http://objective-j.org/">Objective-J</a>. Objective-J (code named Cappuccino), is an Objective-C like language built on JavaScript.</p>

<p>Matt Wizeman stepped up next to demo a WebKit application he's developing to wrap a troublesome time tracking web application. It was interesting the machinations he had to go through to know when the page had finished loading and to transition between pages since the application was JavaScript heavy, using tricks like clickable divs.</p>

<p>I learned quite a bit about WebKit. As soon as I got home I was energized to play with it.</p>

<p>Be sure to come to the next meeting on July 10th (day before iPhone 3G day)!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The folks over at <a href="http://www.aquafadas.com/">Aquafadas</a> are running a
promotion entitled, "<a href="http://givegoodfoodtoyourmac.com/">Give Good Food to Your
Mac.</a>" It's a very sweet deal as you
get to choose from 28 different Mac OS X apps and the more you purchase
the bigger the discount. If you purchase three apps, you get a 30%
discount, 40% for five, 50% for seven and 70% for ten.</p>

<p>Here's a little hint, pick the five apps you really want (even if they
are the most expensive apps available). This will start you off with a
40% discount for the apps you want. Then pick the two cheapest apps --
once this brings your discount up to 50%, the total will probably be
less than it was without those two apps (unless you've only been
choosing the cheapest apps). Finally, pick the next three cheapest apps
-- you should end up with ten apps for a total cost which was less than
price of your original five! You're getting the five apps you want, plus
another five free and then they'll throw in another app at check out
(for me it was <a href="http://www.coladia.com/postino/">Postino</a>, a feed reader
-- I'm not sure if they give the same bonus app away to everyone or
not).</p>

<p>This great deal is time limited and ends on December 9th, so get on over
<a href="http://www.givegoodfood2yourmac.com/kitchen34/index.php">there</a> and
scoop up some great Mac apps.</p>

    <link href="http://sean.github.com/blog/2006/07/27/oscon-sessions-day-one/"/>
    <updated>2006-07-27T20:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sean.github.com/blog/2006/07/27/oscon-sessions-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are my notes from the first day of sessions here at
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a>. The talks I attended
were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using Ruby on Rails to Build a Massive Multiplayer Game</li>
<li>Easy AI with Python</li>
<li>Driving Rails Deep into the Back Office</li>
<li>Streamlined</li>
<li>Ruby for Java Programmers</li>
<li>Coding Wizard, Savvy Trader</li>
</ul>


<p>In the morning, I attended <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/">Michael
Buffingtonâ€™s</a> talk on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8390">â€œUsing
Ruby on Rails to Build a Massive Multiplayer
Gameâ€?</a>.
He gave a nice overview of the development of <a href="http://llor.nu">unroll</a>
discussing isometric art, game design and briefly mentioning
Ajax/JavaScript/script.aculo.us. Hopefully his slides will be available
online shortly. The code for unroll can be downloaded
<a href="http://dev.llor.nu">here</a>. At 11:35am, I was torn between <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike
Clarkâ€™s</a> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8396">Deploying Rails Apps with
Capistrano</a>
and Raymond Hettingerâ€™s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9577">Easy AI with
Python</a>.
Since Iâ€™ve already deployed a couple of Rails apps using Capistrano, I
decided to sneak into the Python camp (I ended up sitting right in front
of Guido). I found the presentation quite interesting and will be
looking into similar libraries for Ruby. Raymond covered the following
topics: neural networks for datamining, solving the mastermind game,
solving sudoku, a Bayesian classifer and, finally, a generic puzzle
solver. Though the slides do not appear to be online yet, the Python
code is available
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python?author=178123">here</a>.
After lunch I attended <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie">Obie
Fernandezâ€™s</a> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8674">Driving Rails Deep
into the Back
Office</a>.
Obie discussed the PCS project for Barclays Bank in Willmington, DE that
Thoughtworks was involved in. He discussed the various ways in which to
get new technology into the very conservative back office of companies,
such as: Trojan horse (sneaking it in), the race (two parallel
development teams using different technologies), the pilot project, the
rescue (for a failed/failing project) and finally undercutting (but he
cautioned that this de-values the work youâ€™re doing). The three key
points of his talk were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Optimize and raise your level of abstraction (by creating custom
DSLs and capturing the requirements in Ruby)</li>
<li>Rails really breathes life into extreme programming (they had one
week iterations on their project)</li>
<li>Donâ€™t sweat performance and scaling (they had their custom DSL
generate SQL directly instead of Ruby to keep the performance up â€“
so you canâ€™t completely ignore performance issues, but theyâ€™re
usually not as bad as you think)</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.relevancellc.com">Stuart Halloway</a> demoed the
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9535">Streamlined</a>
generator for Ruby on Rails â€˜backendâ€™ admin interfaces. Stuart
described Streamlined as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Product ready backend scaffolding</li>
<li>Generic enterprise CRUD</li>
<li>The simplicity of ActiveRecord brought to views and controllers</li>
</ol>


<p>Heâ€™s not going to put the material present online since it is all
basically available via the <a href="http://www.streamlinedframework.org/">Streamlined
blog</a>. Ugo Cei gave a talk
entitled <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8636">Ruby for Java
Programmers</a>
â€“ which confused many folks who thought it was an introduction to Ruby
for those coming from a Java programming background â€“ instead it
covered how to call Ruby from Java and how to call Java from Ruby. All
of the material is covered in his slides, which are available
<a href="http://www.sourcesense.com/transfer/ruby_for_java_programmers.pdf">here</a>.
At the end of his talk he demoâ€™ed Rails running inside of JRuby which
was pretty neat (though very slow and a bit buggy â€“ sometimes
controllers wouldnâ€™t respond). Since Iâ€™ve already written a C
extension for Ruby, I decided to attend a different kind of talk,
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8755">Coding Wizard, Savvy
Trader</a> by
Kartik Subbarao of HP. It was a whirlwind talk covering stocks and
options trading and how to get access to financial information as well
as how to process it using Perl, GreaseMonkey, etc. When the slides are
posted, Iâ€™ll link back to them but here are several of the sites which
were recommended:</p>

    <link href="http://sean.github.com/blog/2005/11/17/nova-jug-special-session/"/>
    <updated>2005-11-17T16:15:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sean.github.com/blog/2005/11/17/nova-jug-special-session</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.novajug.com:8080/">NoVA JUG</a> held a special session on
Thursday night where <a href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com">Tom Copeland</a>
presented on <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/pmd.sf.net">PMD</a> and <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave
Thomas</a> provided an
introduction to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. Held
concurrently was the initial meeting of the NoVA Ruby Users Group -- of
which I hope there will be more meetings. Tom's overview of PMD focused
primarily on CPD, the copy-paste detector. He showed how to run PMD/CPD
and what the results look like (there are a number of plugins for IDEs
to run PMD as well as an ant task). Dave gave a high-level overview of
Rails and showed how quickly you can get webapps up and running using
Rails. He focused on the benefits of Rails from a Java developer's
perspective (since that was the primary audience). He also discussed the
Ruby programming language since many of the attendees were not familiar
with it. Overall, I think he did an excellent job and many folks went
away eager to try out Rails.</p>
