  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight the opening keynotes for OSCON were held. After the
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9521">Google/O’Reilly Open Source
Awards</a>,
Larry Wall gave his annual <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9540">State of the
Onion</a> in
which he talked about his other ‘child’, Perl, and how she’s growing
into adulthood (Perl will be 20 years old this year). After Larry, the
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9541">White Camel
Awards</a>
were given out.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> – usually Paul
Graham speaks on opening night but this year they decided to switch it
up. She gave a talk entitled <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9542">Cognitive
Seduction</a>
which covered her usual Passionate Users content (the presentation was
quite good, I can’t really do it justice here).</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_spkr/24">Damian
Conway</a> read
from his latest work, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9414">The DaVinci
Codebase</a>.
It was a very funny spoof on The DaVinci Code regarding the threat of
Opus Arai (RIAA). The video he played at the end is linked below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.transitionpoint.com">John Paul Ashenfelter</a> gave an
interesting tutorial called <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8704">Rock-solid Web Development: Testing Web
Apps</a>. The
slides are available
<a href="http://www.transitionpoint.com/downloads/oscon2006.zip">here</a>. I’d
heard about <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> before this
presentation, but never took the time to investigate it – after seeing
it used here I’ve already installed it and set it up to test my Rails
app. John Paul started out with an overview of software testing, the
hierarchy of testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Ad Hoc</li>
<li>Unit Testing</li>
<li>Throwing Bodies at it</li>
<li>Bodies with a Test Plan</li>
<li>Automated Test Plan</li>
</ul>


<p>Then he went into the different types of testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Low-level Code (Unit testing done by developers)</li>
<li>App-level (Done by developers and QA)</li>
<li>System level (Load, Performance, Stress)</li>
<li>User level (Usability/User acceptance)</li>
<li>The rest (security, regression, conformance, failover)</li>
</ul>


<p>His important points were that your <strong>users do not do testing</strong> and that
you should <em>always</em> be testing. The next part of the tutorial covered
<a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>. He showed how to run
Selenium (the barriers to entry are extremely low – just HTML and
JavaScript) and then how to record your own tests using the <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide">Selenium
IDE</a>. Once he recorded a simple
test, which is just an HTML table with three columns, we saw how it
could be easily edited and run. Selenium Remote Control was brought-up
next and code examples in Java, Python and Ruby were shown – here’s the
Ruby example:</p>

<pre><code>  def testHome
puts selenium.open "http://oscon/"
puts selenium.clickAndWait "link=Constitution"
puts selenium.assertTitle "Cat Club - Constitution"
end
</code></pre>

<p>The third part of the tutorial covered Automation and Continuous
Integration which used <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> to run Selenium.
Before Selenium was launched by Ant,
<a href="http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/">dbUnit</a> was used to get the database
into a known state prior to the Selenium tests being run. Finally, the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/grinder">Grinder</a> load testing
framework was discussed. An alternative, <a href="http://opensta.org/">OpenSTA</a>
was also briefly mentioned – but John Paul focused on Grinder 3. He
showed how you can record a script using the TCPProxy portion of Grinder
and then starting and agent and running from the console which hit his
server with 100 users (5 processes with 20 threads each). His take home
lessions were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Testing gives you confidence in your code and your application</li>
<li>Users are NOT your testers</li>
<li>Good programmers always write tests</li>
<li>Selenium will save you time</li>
<li>If you repeat it, automate it</li>
<li>Load testing is pretty complicated</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I attended <a href="http://www.relevancellc.com/">Stuart
Halloway’s</a> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8520">Ajax on
Rails</a>
tutorial. The slides from his presentation are available
<a href="http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ruby/rails/ajax_rails">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ruby/rails/rjs">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ajax/prototype">here</a>. This was
the first time I’d attended one of Stuart’s presentations and I was
impressed by his relaxed presentation style. He also seems to be a
genuinely nice fellow – during the break, I spoke briefly with him to
see if he would be interested in speaking about
<a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com">Streamlined</a> to the <a href="http://www.novarug.org">NoVA
RUG</a>. Stuart started off by asking us what the
really successful (and big) companies of the past few years have in
common – the answer was their use of open source. Yahoo!, Google,
Amazon, etc didn’t go out and purchase an enterprise solution from
Microsoft or Sun, they built it themselves using freely available open
source tools. So he positioned Ruby on Rails and Ajax as enablers to
help you build the next great company. After a brief introduction to
Prototype, Stuart went into several examples using Ajax with Rails: Ajax
Search, Degradable Ajax, Autocomplete, and Drag and Drop. After that he
went into RJS discussing RJS templates, inline RJS, detecting AJAX on
the server-side, element and collection proxies, and testing RJS using
<a href="http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/29/guide-test-driven-rjs-with-arts">ARTS</a>.
He also gave a brief demo of
<a href="http://streamlined.relevancellc.com">Streamlined</a>, which he’ll expand
upon at his session tomorrow. Finally, he wrapped up with a look at
Prototype and it’s spin on JavaScript – making it friendly for Ruby
developers. He’ll cover more on Prototype in his session tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon I attended <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8936">Asterisk Inside and
Out</a> by
<a href="http://www.saintjoe.edu/faculty/specific/cs.html">Brian Capouch</a>. His
presentation is available
<a href="http://www.network-voice.com/oscon/tutorial.pdf">here</a> while all of the
<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> configuration files can be obtained
<a href="http://www.network-voice.com/oscon/">here</a>. The tutorial was based on
his forthcoming book, <em>Asterisk Inside and Out: Do-it-yourself Open
Source Telephony</em>, from Addison-Wesley.</p>

<p>Following the slides, Brian performed several demos which displayed the
power of Asterisk. He started with a simple ‘Hello World’ example where
the caller was played a short message. Next he demonstrated the server
calling you back (and playing a pre-recorded message). Then he called an
inside extension, an outside of the system (on to the PSTN via the FXO),
and called an inside extension from outside (via the PSTN and FXO).
After that he showed a ‘road warrior’ who ran a local instance of
Asterisk on their laptop which registered with the home office and then
called the office number of the ‘road warrior’ and the call was
automatically redirected to the laptop. Following that, he configured
the laptop as a remote office and dialed an extension at the ‘remote
office’ from the ‘local office’, which was properly routed through the
system. Finally, he demonstrated an intra-office transfer of an incoming
POTS call.</p>

<p>Asterisk appears to be an amazing application and there is quite a bit
more that I need to learn about it. It seems like it would be a fun
project to setup at home (if my wife will agree to it – which is
doubtful).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I attended <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy’s</a> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8933">JavaScript
Boot Camp</a>
tutorial. The slides should be available online shortly at Amy’s website
– I’ll update this post once she publishes them. She provided a good
overview of JavaScript as a language, some of the issues with the
various implementations, how to debug it and some of the libraries
available for use. <strong>Updated</strong>: The slides are located
<a href="http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/07/26/javascript-boot-camp-tutorial">here</a>.
Unfortunately, the material was a little too introductory for me, I
thought she’d spend less time on the JavaScript basics and more on the
intermediate/advanced techniques of the language and libraries. I guess
I misunderstood what I had signed-up for. Anyway, she started out with
the history of the JavaScript language (briefly mentioning the
LiveScript name … which Rich Kilmer quizzed me on at <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/articles/2006/07/20/july-novarug-meeting">my RJS
talk</a>)
and the ECMAScript process which spawned several different releases of
JavaScript – basically most browsers implement JavaScript 1.5 with the
exception of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> which gives us
JavaScript 1.6. At this point we lost power to everything but the
projector, but Amy took it in stride and continued her presentation. She
went through the syntax of the JavaScript language, keywords, etc. After
getting through the language quirks, she discussed how to use
<a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">FireBug</a> and the
<a href="http://www.squarefree.com/shell/">JavaScript shell</a> to test and debug
your JavaScript code. Some of the libraries which were mentioned
include: <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>, <a href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a>,
<a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a>,
<a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">moo.fx</a>,
<a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behavior</a>, and
<a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>. When asked for her favorite
JavaScript related sites she gave her top three:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">QuirksMode</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a></li>
