  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight was the monthly <a href="http://www.novarug.org">NovaRUG</a> meeting and
<a href="http://www.bosatsu.net">Brian Sletten</a> presented on DRb while I
presented on
<a href="http://www.codyfauser.com/articles/2005/11/20/rails-rjs-templates">RJS</a>.
My presentation and code is available
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/files/rjs-talk.zip">here</a>. I think it went
over pretty well and I made several new contacts after the meeting which
is always nice. Brianâ€™s presentation is available
<a href="http://www.bosatsu.net/talks/DRb.pdf">here</a> â€“ so I donâ€™t need to
provide the usual coverage that I do. He gave a very engaging and
amusing talk that everyone enjoyed. One interesting note, not covered in
his slides but played following his presentation, is that a Japanese
band called The Blue Hearts wrote a song called <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=102599671&amp;id=102602550&amp;s=143462">â€œRinda,
Rindaâ€?</a>
â€“ though it appears to have no relation to the <a href="http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/drb/rinda/index.html">Rinda
tuplespace</a>
library as the song was first released in 1987.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight at <a href="http://www.novarug.org/">NovaRUG</a> we had two presenters:
<a href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/">Tom Copeland</a> and Xandy Johnson. Tom
spoke about extending Ruby with C extensions and Xandy spoke about
<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>. Tom walked through the ‘evolution’
of his <a href="http://revolution.rubyforge.org/">Revolution</a> Ruby library which
provides Ruby bindings for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">GNOME Evolution
PIM</a> (via the e-book library).
His first example was the straight-forward way of extending Ruby with C
(the code example looked very similar to those in Chapter 21 of the
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Pick Axe</a>).
There’s also an
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/18/extending_ruby.html">article</a>
at OnLamp about extending Ruby with C. His second example was more
interesting, for me at least – he showed how to use <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-dl2/">Ruby
DL2</a> to export C functions into
a Ruby module using pure Ruby code! It’s as easy as this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'dl/import'

module Foo
extend Importer

dlload 'libc'

extern "size_t strlen(const char *)"
end

s = "Hello, World!"
puts "#{s} is #{Foo.strlen(s)} characters long."
</code></pre>

<p>After that, Tom spoke briefly about <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> for
<a href="http://www.goto.info.waseda.ac.jp/~fukusima/ruby/swig-e.html">Ruby</a>.
Unfortunately, he had difficulty getting it to work and no one else
present had been successful with it (or was willing to speak about it).
Xandy was up next with an excellent overview of <a href="http://onestepback.org/">Jim
Weirich’s</a>
<a href="http://onestepback.org/articles/buildingwithrake/">Rake</a>. He started
off with a nice poem entitled ‘Ode to Rake’ which I will not republish
as he was going to send it over to Jim and I don’t want to ruin that
(there were suggestions that <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/">_why</a>
should turn it into a song). Xandy provided an overview of other popular
build tools like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> and
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> (and we all had a good time <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie?entry=ant_was_a_one_day">complaining
about Ant</a>).
Next he delved into the Rakefile sytax (after reminding us that Rake is
all Ruby; so anything you can do in Ruby you can do in Rake) and
discussed tasks, file tasks, directory tasks, rules, FileLists, sh (for
calling out to the shell), ruby (for invoking another Ruby interpreter),
package, rdoc and gem. Near the end of his presentation, he winged his
way through namespaces, dependency import and
<a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/classes/Rake/MultiTask.html">multitask</a>.
Overall it was an excellent introduction to Rake which whetted our
appetites for a deeper dive into Rake. Next month I’ll be presenting on
<a href="http://www.codyfauser.com/articles/2005/11/20/rails-rjs-templates">Rails RJS
Templates</a>,
on July 19th.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago I heard about the
’<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2005/11/11/why-engines-and-components-are-not-evil-but-distracting">controversy</a>’
surrounding <a href="http://www.railsengines.org/">Rails Engines</a> and meant to
check them out, though work/life intervened and I never got around to it
until now. So last week I setup a <a href="http://www.rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>
project (thanks <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich</a> and
<a href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/">Tom</a>!) called
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/blogengine/">BlogEngine</a> to learn the ins
and outs of creating a Rails Engine. At first blush, Rails Engines seem
to be plugins on steroids, incredibly powerful but somewhat dangerous.
For those who haven’t yet visited the Rails Engines website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Engines are a way of dropping in whole chunks of functionality into
your existing application without affecting any of your existing code.
Engines are like a slice of an application from top (views/helpers) to
bottom (models) which can be dropped into an existing application and
appear as if they always existed in the normal /app directory.
Developers can selectively override parts of Engines as they need to
handle their application (such as changing the user/home view to
display a silly name, without affecting the rest of the Engine).
Engines can be as lightweight as the simplest plugin, or as
full-featured as your your (<em>sic</em>) imagination can conceive.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.railsengines.org/wiki/pages/James+Adam">James Adam</a> has done
an excellent job documenting the Rails Engine plugin and the Wiki with
how to create your own Rails Engines. That said, while I found the
development of my BlogEngine to be relatively painless (as it was
developed like any other Rails apps), once it was converted to a Rails
Engine it was difficult to integrate into another project and get the
interaction with the
<a href="http://www.railsengines.org/login_engine">LoginEngine</a> working
smoothly. The Rails Engines plugin does make it dead simple to add a lot
of functionality into your application with very little work. But due to
the wholesale inclusion of models, views and controllers it does take a
bit of work to get the engine tweaked to your liking (at least so that
it integrates into your existing Rails app nicely). To create your own
Rails Engine you would create a new Rails project, write your tests and
app code as normal and then perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the Rails Engine plugin:</p>

<pre><code>./script/plugin install engines
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Generate the directory structure for your new engine and choose a
license:</p>

<pre><code>./script/generate engine MyNewEngine
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Move your engine files from the main app directory into the
vendor/plugins/my_new_engine directory:</p>

<pre><code>mv app/models/my_model.rb vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/app/models/
mv db/migrate/001_initial.rb vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/db/migrate/
mv app/controllers/my_controller.rb vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/app/controllers/
mv app/views/my vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/app/views/
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Modify config/environment.rb to start your engine:</p>

<pre><code>Engines.start :my_new_engine
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Include your new engine in ApplicationController/Helper:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
include MyNewEngine
end
module ApplicationHelper
include UploadEngine
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Modify vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/lib/my_new_engine.rb with
any configuration options you require and add any modules you need
to vendor/plugins/my_new_engine/lib/my_new_engine/</p></li>
<li>Read and then update the README in vendor/plugins/my_new_engine so
that you and others can figure out how to use your new engine.</li>
</ol>


<p>Some of the issues I had with Rails Engines were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Model handling</strong>. For the BlogEngine, I relied upon the
LoginEngine, unfortunately I had to enhance the User model with
relationships to blogs, articles, etc – thankfully the LoginEngine
was designed such that I could simply include the
LoginEngine::AuthenticatedUser module. Thus you must take great care
when developing an engine so that the models are setup properly.</li>
<li><p><strong>Migration handling</strong>. Migrations with engines can be very
dangerous as you must trust the source of the engine (though this is
true for all code you incorporate into your application). That said,
it would be nice if running</p>

<pre><code>rake migrate
</code></pre>

<p>also ran the migrations for each of the installed engines. Note that
the order in which the migrations is run is very important if the
engines have dependencies on on another. Which brings me to the next
item …</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Engine dependencies</strong>. The init_engine.rb should allow you to
require any pre-requisite engines. Then Engine.start wouldn’t care
in which order the engines were started since they would be
self-ordering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Referencing image assets</strong>. The engines plugin provides support
for accessing your CSS stylesheets and Javascript files via</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= engine_stylesheet "" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= engine_javascript "" %&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Referencing CSS and Javascript</strong>. In the above case you had to use
the engine name as your .css and .js filenames or provide the
additional filenames on the same line after the engine name. Since
the engine should know where the view file came from it should look
in that engine’s public directory for the stylesheet/Javascript
files.</p></li>
<li><strong>Testing Engines with fixtures</strong>. As long as you don’t allow the
users of your engine to change your table names the fixtures you’ve
written for your tests will work fine. Unfortunately, once the table
names have changed it is up to the user to rename the fixture files.</li>
</ul>


<p>In theory, Rails Engines appear to be quite nice, but in my limited
amount of time using them I prefer to reuse plugins, write my own code
from scratch or reuse other classes in lib.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich Kilmer</a> presented his
<a href="http://alph.rubyforge.org/">Alph</a> <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> to
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/">Flash</a> bridge. I had
checked out Alph before (version 0.0.3 from 2004) but was unable to get
it working. Rich said that he’d place an updated copy up on
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/alph/">RubyForge</a> soon. The way to setup
the bridge looks slightly different in his new version:</p>

<pre><code>conn = Alph::ConnectionManager.new
flash = Alph::FlashVM.new("id", conn)
</code></pre>

<p>Rich also had a demo with multiple bar charts which were dynamically
updated from the Ruby server when the user clicked on the ‘play’ button
in the Flash VM running in the browser. If he posts the code, I’ll add a
link to it. Basically the Flash code creates two movies within the root
movie and adds a text field to each along with a button which calls back
to the Ruby server. This Flash code is compiled with the
<a href="http://www.mtasc.org/">MTASC</a> compiler to create the SWF which runs in
the Flash player (in the browser). The Ruby code uses the code I
mentioned above (in a separate thread) and then registers itself for
callbacks – when it is called back it injects the progress bar into the
running Flash movies (and twiddles with the text in the text fields,
also in the Flash movies). Alph is currently being used by
<a href="http://www.infoether.com/">InfoEther</a>’s <a href="http://www.getindi.com/">indi</a>
platform. In this case both the Flash client and the Ruby server run on
the same machine. After his talk, Rich mentioned the
<a href="http://haxe.org/">haXe</a> and <a href="http://nekovm.org/">Neko</a> projects from
Nicolas Cannasse of <a href="http://www.motion-twin.com/">Motion-Twin</a>. They
book look like very interesting projects and there are rumors that Ruby
is being ported to the Neko VM (so now we have Rite/YARV and others
working on a VM for Ruby – why can’t all of these folks work together?)
The next NovaRUG meeting will be at FGM in Reston, VA on June 28 – Xandy
will be presenting on <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>. I’m definitely
looking forward to it.</p>
