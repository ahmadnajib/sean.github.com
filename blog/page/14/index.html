  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was playing around with <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> this morning and
noticed <a href="http://www.digg.com/spy">Digg Spy</a>. At first I thought it was
really cool and wondered how they did that. Then I realized it’s just a
bit of Ajax and, as anyone who’s read <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ajax/index.html">Pragmatic
Ajax</a> knows, Ajax
is easy! So read on for how I implemented an Ajax spy in
<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> and to download the code. The first
thing I did was generate a controller and model using <a href="http://www.height1percent.com/">Rich White’s
excellent</a><a href="http://ajaxscaffold.height1percent.com/">AjaxScaffold
Generator</a>, called
EntriesController and Entry, respectively. This gave me a nice way to
create new entries easily. After that I added some basic login/signup
support so that the entries could be associated with users. So far,
nothing out of the ordinary. Next I created a new controller called
SpyController, this is where all of the action happens. I added a basic
list method which just returns all of the entries in the DB (sorry, no
pagination), this is what we initially call when displaying the page.
Then I added an update method which will be called periodically to
retrieve new entries, it looks like this:</p>

<p>~~~~ {lang=&#8221;ruby&#8221;}
def update
  last_update = Time.parse(params[:timestamp])
  # locate all of the entries created since the last update
  @entries = Entry.find(:all, :order => &#8216;created_at ASC&#8217;, :conditions => [ &#8216;created_at > ?&#8217;, last_update.to_s(:db) ]);
  if !@entries.empty?</p>

<pre><code>render :update do |page|
  for entry in @entries
    page.insert_html(:top, 'spy-list', :partial =&gt; 'entry', :object =&gt; entry)
    page.visual_effect :highlight, "spy-item-#{entry.id}"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
~~~~</p>

<p>At this point I needed some JavaScript to call the update method, so put
the following code in application.js:</p>

<p>~~~~ {lang=&#8221;ruby&#8221;}
var updateInterval = 5000; // update every 5 seconds
var timestamp = new Date().toUTCString();
var timer;</p>

<p>function go() {
  timer = setInterval(&#8216;update()&#8217;, updateInterval);
}</p>

<p>function update() {
  url = &#8220;/spy/update&#8221;;
  new Ajax.Request(url, {</p>

<pre><code>           asynchronous: true,
           method: "get",
           parameters: "timestamp=" + timestamp,
           onSuccess: function(request) {
             timestamp = new Date().toUTCString();
           }
</code></pre>

<p>  });
}
~~~~</p>

<p>The JavaScript update method calls the SpyController’s update method and
passes a timestamp as a parameter (this is the time when the page was
loaded, initially, and later the timestamp is updated as new entries are
retrieved). To bring it all together I had to add on onload to the
list.rhtml view for the SpyController, like this:</p>

<p>~~~~ {lang=&#8221;html&#8221;}
This page updates automatically!</p>

<p>  &lt;% if !@entries.empty? %></p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; 'entry', :collection =&gt; @entries, :locals =&gt; { :hidden =&gt; false } %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  &lt;% end %>
~~~~</p>

<p>That’s all there is to it. See, I told you it’s easy! You can download
the code from

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know that really cool screencast at the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on
Rails</a> website where Rails is used to create
a <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/flickr-rails-ajax.mov">Flickr interface in 5
minutes</a>?
Well, I followed the screencast and built my own copy and then I
enhanced it with some additional JavaScript (Lightbox style preview of
the images and a blind-up on subsequent searches). Note that in the
course of making my changes I found out the proper ordering of the
JavaScript callbacks (see
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/PrototypeHelper.html#M000412">this</a>)
– even though you would think that :before would be called prior to a
:complete, it doesn’t always happen that way (so sometimes the new
results are blinded-up and not shown).</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to upload this for awhile, but just haven’t gotten
around to it. So today I updated it to work with Rails 1.1.1 (though
didn’t switch the Ajax-y goodness over to RJS). Hopefully other folks
can benefit from the code. To run it all you have to do is first install
the flickr ruby gem, like so:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install flickr
</code></pre>

<p>and unzip and run this <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/flickr.zip">Rails
app</a>.
Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m curious why I can&#8217;t find anyone experimenting with the use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity">superconductors</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-temperature_superconductor">high
temperature
superconducting</a>
(HTS) wire, specifically) in networking applications. I realize that
fiber is really cheap now and HTS wiring is not. But it would be nice to
see the transmission distances, for example, for an HTS version of Cat 6
with RJ-45 style connectors. I find it annoying that you have to
clean/polish the ends of fiber and dealing with two connectors is a
pain. Though I think the LC duplex connectors are an improvement over
the SC/FC/ST connectors. Plus I&#8217;ve seen what happens when you bend
fibers too far and have to replace or splice it. Then again, I&#8217;m not
that familiar with HTS wire so it may have some of the same issues
(though surely it can&#8217;t be as brittle as glass). Since fiber supports
DWDM, I don&#8217;t think HTS cable will take off, but it would still be
interesting to see the comparison. This would be core network/long haul
usage &#8230; in the long run, I think that wireless will win out in the
last mile since it doesn&#8217;t require the expense of burying fiber. If
anyone knows more about HTS wire being used in networking applications
please send me an email or leave a comment here. Thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a bit late in posting about it (due to extreme busyness at home and
at work), but Devin Mullins gave a nice overview of metaprogramming with
Ruby at the March Northern VA Ruby Users Group meeting. Devin&#8217;s talk,
entitled &#8220;The Tao of Metaprogramming&#8221;, was more of an exploration of
Ruby&#8217;s metaprogramming support in an irb session than the standard
PowerPoint/Keynote presentation. He covered the reflection support in
Ruby to see which methods a class responds to as well as how to add
methods dynamically to object instances and classes using
define_method, instance_method, class_eval, method_missing and eval.
Ostensibly, the talk was subtitled &#8220;ActiveRecord&#8217;s Not Black Magic&#8221; but
due to the number of questions/discussion we didn&#8217;t get into
ActiveRecord that much &#8211; Devin did start to discuss it but I felt that
we only scratched the surface. Overall, I though it was a very good talk
and cleared up some of my questions regarding metaprogramming in Ruby. I
still wish that someone (preferably the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic
Programmers</a>) would publish a book with
a focus on metaprogramming in Ruby and writing domain specific
languages. Why&#8217;s discussion of writing a DSL in Ruby called <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-6.html#section3">Dwemthy’s
Array</a> is nice
(and funny), but I&#8217;d like to see something deeper. Perhaps, I&#8217;m wrong
and it&#8217;s not enough for a full length book, but I&#8217;d be willing to pay
for a <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html">Fridays</a> type of
short PDF if it were available.</p>
