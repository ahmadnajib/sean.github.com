  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, I&#8217;d like to apologize for the long delay in posting to my blog.
My wife and I had our second child at the end of September and things
have been hectic since then. I was playing around with the <a href="http://script.aculo.us/demos/ajax/autocompleter">ajax
autocompletion</a> code
from script.aculo.us but couldn&#8217;t get it working in my own code. It
turns out that in addition to prototype.js in your layout RHTML, you
also need to include effects.js and controls.js, so the code looks as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the controller, I wrote my own autocomplete_for_XXX method since I
wanted to search several different fields in my database. Note that
there is probably a much better way to achieve the following without
making three different calls to find and without making calls using LIKE
%foo% &#8230;</p>

<pre><code>  def auto_complete_for_resource_name
@search_term = params[:resource][:name].strip.downcase
@resources = Resource.find(:all,
:conditions =&gt; [ 'LOWER(name) LIKE ?',
'%' + @search_term + '%' ],
:order =&gt; 'name ASC',
:limit =&gt; 10)
@resources.concat(Location.find(:all,
:conditions =&gt; [ 'LOWER(name) LIKE ?',
'%' + @search_term + '%' ],
:order =&gt; 'name ASC',
:limit =&gt; 10))
@resources.concat(EqType.find(:all,
:conditions =&gt; [ 'LOWER(name) LIKE ?',
'%' + @search_term + '%' ],
:order =&gt; 'name ASC',
:limit =&gt; 10))
@resources.uniq!
render :partial =&gt; 'resources'
end
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll need a partial _resources.html such as this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class="resources"&gt;
&lt;% for resource in @resources do -%&gt;
&lt;li class="resource"&gt;
&lt;div class="name"&gt;&lt;%=h resource.name %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in the RHTML where you want the autocompletion to appear you
need to add a text_field_with_autocomplete, but since I&#8217;m using this
in a search field (similar to Google&#8217;s usage), I needed to place it
within a form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= start_form_tag :action =&gt; 'search' %&gt;
&lt;label for="reservation_resource"&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :resource, :name %&gt;
&lt;%= submit_tag 'Search' %&gt;
&lt;%= end_form_tag %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. Hope that helps &#8211; all of the other
documentation I&#8217;ve seen only has you include prototype.js and that&#8217;s
where I ran into difficulty.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After attending OSCON session on <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/?p=35">Yahoo!
Widgets</a> by Jeffrey McManus, I decided
I would try to write a widget which connected to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on
Rails</a>. First, the Yahoo! Widget (aka
Konfabulator) app is located
<a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/download">here</a> and the developer
documentation is located <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/workshop/">here</a>.
Second, to save time, I simply modified the Depot code from the
excellent <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with
Rails</a> (I
hope Dave and David don&#8217;t mind). You will need to first download the
code for the book and extract the depot_final project (and setup your
database, etc). Then you can download my code
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/assets/rails_widget.zip">here</a> and clobber
admin_controller.rb with my version, then add shipping.rxml in the
views/admin subdirectory. Finally, the JavaScript source code for the
widget is located in SimpleDemo.widget/Contents/SimpleDemo.kon file (you
might need to rename SimpleDemo.widget to SimpleDemo.widget.zip to unzip
it and view the source). It should be pretty easy to understand as I&#8217;ve
commented it well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some observations from
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCON</a>. The short form is
that <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby,</a><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on
Rails</a> and
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> were the biggest things around at
this year&#8217;s OSCON, closely followed by Ajax. My more detailed
observations are continued below (except for Ubuntu, since I can&#8217;t
really add anything &#8211; I use it, I like it, but if another Linux
distribution comes along that I like better I&#8217;ll easily switch).While
Java and Perl still occupy a significant mind-share, it appears that
share is receding. Perhaps we are at an inflection point, where the
(open source) development community is moving towards Ruby (and Python).
To an Java/Perl programmers reading this, I suggest you learn one or
both of these languages. Due to work, I had to learn Python first and
Ruby in my spare time &#8211; the Pythonistas will probably lynch me, but if
I had a choice I would&#8217;ve skipped Python in favor of Ruby. It seems that
there is a bit of (albeit friendly) competition between the Rubyists and
Pythonistas &#8211; though instead of copying killer apps (*cough*
<a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/hissHissChooChoo.html">Subway</a>
*cough*) the two groups should work together to help those poor souls
stuck in Java, C/C++ and Perl move into the 21st century (or back to the
middle of the 20th century, since Lisp had all of these goodies first &#8211;
I couldn&#8217;t resist ;-)). Developing web-apps is hugely popular as
evidenced by all of the love going <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on
Rails&#8217;</a> way as well as the interest
surrounding Ajax. <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/">Alex Russell</a>, of <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo
Toolkit fame</a>, gave a couple of different
tutorials/sessions on Ajax/JavaScript and both were quite full (the
tutorial was sold out). Now Alex is a great speaker and seems like a
nice guy, but I don&#8217;t think all those people were there just for him &#8211;
the recent coining of the XMLHTTP &#8220;technology&#8221; Ajax (which has been
around in IE for quite a while) seems to have brought it to the
forefront (that and the folks using our web-apps are more savvy today
and won&#8217;t put up with full page refreshes and stupid web UIs which make
them jump through hoops). I&#8217;m just getting up to speed on this stuff
myself since the majority of programming work has been with
&#8220;traditional&#8221; client-apps. Since most open source developers have the
luxury of choosing their programming language when starting a project,
they will usually choose the one they are most productive in. Companies
need to anticipate this change so they can hire the best developers.
Developers who do not take the initiative may find themselves in danger
of losing their jobs, as unlike the transitions from FORTRAN to C or C++
to Java, many businesses have realizes they can find just as well
educated employees in countries with much lower costs of labor.
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> still gets quite a bit of &#8220;love&#8221; from
the open source community. I&#8217;m a bit surprised at this &#8211; not to say
that Google is bad (or &#8220;evil&#8221;) in any way &#8211; just that Google is
perceived as the internet leader. What about Yahoo!? Yes, everyone here
still loves Flickr as well (and it is somewhat deserved), but I think
the euphoria around Google has created an RDF
(<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> folks will know what I mean). The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net">Yahoo!
Developer</a> network has released a bunch of
new APIs/tools within the last couple of weeks which are amazing.
Because of this, I think that either Google&#8217;s stock is currently
overvalued or Yahoo! is undervalued &#8211; it is probably the former, but
since uncovered shorts are risky (and Google stock is still so
volatile), I&#8217;d recommend buying Yahoo! instead. <strong>Disclaimer, I don&#8217;t
own any Yahoo! or Google stock, <em>yet</em>.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The OSCON <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/keynotes.html#fri">Friday
Keynotes</a>
are over and here are my notes. To save folks some trouble (in case none
of these people interest them), I&#8217;ve listed the speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conference Announcements - Nat Torkington, O&#8217;Reilly Media, Inc.</li>
<li>Linux - In Search of the Desktop - Asa Dotzler, Mozilla Foundation</li>
<li>Open Source Biology - Drew Endy, MIT Biological Engineering</li>
<li>Open Source Licensing Issues - Tony Gaughan, Computer Associates</li>
<li>On Evil - Danny O&#8217;Brien, Need To Know</li>
<li>Howtoons - Saul Griffith, Squid Labs</li>
</ul>


<p>And the afternoon closing session was keynoted by Miguel de Icaza. The
first speaker was Asa Dotzler from the Mozilla Foundation regarding his
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/008499.html">controversial
post</a> that
Linux is not ready for the desktop and what the Linux developer
community needs to do to get it there. In general, I agree with Asa&#8217;s
points regarding Linux &#8211; but I think it is largely irrelevant (or will
be) now that all of the interesting applications are moving on to the
web &#8211; pretty soon folks won&#8217;t care what OS their machines are running
as long as the browser works (perhaps Linux on the desktop will
eventually win &#8211; but as a cut down, minimal OS that runs on the
cheapest commodity hardware and simply boots quickly into a full-screen
browser). Next was Drew Endy and Assoc. Prof at MIT Biological
Engineering. His presentation on DNA as the code for writing/building
biological organisms was quite good. It seems that they are also dealing
with difficult patent issues in his field as well because as companies
discover which strings of DNA-code do what, they immediately patent the
work. He gave the example of students who made an organism which
essentially took photographs (the billions of bacteria would rearrange
themselves to reproduce the image shone onto them) &#8211; this was only
possible because the building blocks necessary for this project were
freely given to them by the various universities which own the patents
on them. Following Drew was Tony Gaughan from Computer Associates, at
first I thought this was going to be another marketing keynote, this
time for CA&#8217;s Ingress open source database. While Tony did mention
Ingress quite a bit he also went over the open source licenses which
have been written in the last few years and how this &#8220;explosion&#8221; of
licenses is not sustainable, fractures the open source community and in
general makes this very difficult for commercial interests who wish to
use and contribute back to open source projects. I completely agree with
this and think that the OSI needs to do something about it. If they can
boil down the essence of each of the existing licenses and build up a
sort-of template library of licenses where-by developers could simply
use one or more templates to licenses their software. Danny O&#8217;Brien, the
editor of Need To Know (and now apparently affiliated with the EFF) gave
a hilarous talk on &#8220;evil&#8221;. I can&#8217;t really do a good job of conveying it
since you really had to be there. Finally, what I thought was the most
interesting talk came from Saul Griffith of <a href="http://www.squid-labs.com/">Squid
Labs</a>. He spoke about the
<a href="http://www.howtoons.org/">HowToons</a> comics which his company is
developing (there are plans for a book as well) to get kids interested
in science and engineering (and let them have a lot of fun while doing
it) as well as the <a href="http://www.ifabricate.com/">iFabricate</a> document and
collaboration system for helping people share projects with one another
in a standardized way. He then showed videos of some of the projects
they have implemented with kids. For afternoon closing session, Miguel
de Icaza (of Novell) spoke about Linux on the desktop and the work at
Novell to completely replace MS Office with OpenOffice (done) and
replace MS Windows with Linux (50% done). He spoke about the portable
usability testing lab they have to watch how Windows users deal with the
migration to Linux (this information is passed back to the Linux/GNOME
developers). He then gave a demo of the forth-coming OpenSuSe Linux
distribution with a completely re-written UI layer that is &#8220;quartz-like&#8221;
in that it renders to PDF using OpenGL (hardware or software emulation).
The demo was really neat, he could change desktops by simply dragging
the desktop around (as it was really a cube), he show how quickly moving
windows made them wobble (like Jello), he showed an Expose-like feature
which unstacked the windows so you could find what you&#8217;re looking for
and he showed a video playing that was moved halfway between desktops &#8211;
so that when he tried to switch to the next desktop the movie window
bent around the corner of the cube (and it still played fine). ISOs for
this should be available sometime next week, he said. Overall, it was an
interesting tcchnology demo &#8211; not much new was said. Since I&#8217;ve got to
go to the airport, I&#8217;ll post my OSCON observations and thoughts on the
trends of software development over the weekend. I had a great time at
OSCON and hope to come back next year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Phillip Torrone, the Associate Editor of Make Magazine, demoed some
great
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7456">Do-It-Yourself</a>
items and talked a bit about the recent resurge in the DIY movement. He
showed how to replace the Japanese firmware on the Sony Libre with an
English version &#8211; after that you can download tons of eBooks. He also
passed it around and the resolution is amazing, even in direct light.
Following that he showed how you can use homebrew games as well as a web
browser (from the crappy Wipeout game) on a Sony PSP (as long as you
haven&#8217;t upgraded the firmware to 2.0). After that he showed us his mouse
bot (as seen in Make magazine) which gets him into trouble with the TSA
each time he travels. Then he showed Linux on the iPod &#8211; it&#8217;s ability
to record up to 96Khz quality audio and play back video. He also showed
us what he did with this iPod box (made it into a cardboard/foam robot
for kids). The penultimate demo was a powerful green laser which
cooks/burns anything red (he demonstrated by popping red balloons).
Finally, he demo&#8217;ed an old rotary phone which he hooked up to a cell
phone (then folks made several phone calls to/from his franken-rotary
phone). I highly recommend subscribing to
<a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make</a> &#8211; you won&#8217;t be disappointed. Update
from PDX&#8217;s Free WiFi: Phillip Torrone posted
<a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/08/fun_with_lasers.html">video</a>
from his &#8220;mini-MAKER&#8221; fair on Wednesday night at OSCON and I&#8217;m in the
video! Well, part of me is, I&#8217;m standing to the right of (left of, from
the camera&#8217;s perspective) and slightly behind the laser so you can see
my khaki pants and red shirt.</p>
