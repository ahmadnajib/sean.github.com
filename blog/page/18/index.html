  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Russell gave an interesting talk this morning on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6985">Building
Responsive Web UIs with
DHTML</a>. My
notes are below. Updated Aug 6, 12:38: I fixed the errors in the post
pointed out by Alex Russell. BTW, he&#8217;s an excelllent speaker, if he ever
gives a talk and you are able to go, I heartily recommend doing so.</p>

<h2>Building Responsive Web UIs with DHTML</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Alex Russell</a> Namespaces</p>

<ul>
<li>you NOT are the only thing in the interpreter. deal</li>
<li>do nothing in global namesapce</li>
<li>declare the start of a namespace</li>
<li>Object.prototype.foo = &#8220;&#8221;; is EVIL</li>
<li>MyObject.prototype.foo = &#8220;&#8221;; is GOOD</li>
</ul>


<p>Events: The old way</p>

<ul>
<li>clients treated a dumb renderers</li>
<li>iframes make some partial content workable</li>
</ul>


<p>Events the DHTML way</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple models</li>
<li>onclick=&#8221;foo()&#8221;</li>
<li>DOM2 style: attachEvent (or addEventListener for IE6)</li>
</ul>


<p>Events the Dojo way</p>

<ul>
<li>dojo.event.connect()</li>
<li>transparently handles multiple listeners</li>
<li>makes browser differences go away</li>
<li>builds in memory leak protection for IE</li>
<li>connects normal functions too, not just DOM nodes</li>
<li>dojo.event.connect(fooNode, &#8220;onclick&#8221;, doFoo);</li>
<li>dojo.event.topic.subscribe(&#8220;/foo&#8221;, bar, &#8220;baz&#8221;);</li>
<li>dojo.event.topic.publish(&#8220;/foo&#8221;, &#8220;arg1&#8221;, &#8220;arg2&#8221;);</li>
</ul>


<p>AOP &#8230; Say What?</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspect oriented</li>
<li>does name method interception</li>
<li>advice types available past the default of after</li>
</ul>


<p>I/O: the old way</p>

<ul>
<li>full page refreshes</li>
<li>iframes provided some partial page refresh capability</li>
</ul>


<p>I/O the DHTML way</p>

<ul>
<li><p>XMLHttp requests</p>

<ul>
<li>sync or async</li>
<li>browser capability detection code</li>
<li>no file upload</li>
<li>usability problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>iframes</p>

<ul>
<li>ugly, gratuitous hacks</li>
<li>plays nice with forms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I/O the Dojo way</p>

<ul>
<li>common interface to multiple &#8220;transports&#8221;, incl. XMLHttp</li>
<li>single response and multi response API (ready for LivePage,
mod_pubsub, etc).</li>
</ul>


<p>Packaging the old way</p>

<ul>
<li>tags</li>
<li>absolute URLs

<ul>
<li>External CSS files and template systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>Packaging the DHTML way</p>

<ul>
<li>tags</li>
<li>no dependency tracking</li>
<li>no load ordering</li>
<li>no transparent optimization</li>
</ul>


<p>Packaging the Dojo way</p>

<ul>
<li><p>built in pkg system:</p>

<ul>
<li>integrates and is transparent with the build system</li>
<li>yes, we make builds to optimize your code for you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>dependency satisfaction at runtime or build time</p></li>
<li>partial builds can call source versions of this that aren&#8217;t baked in</li>
<li>just use dojo.require()</li>
</ul>


<p>Widget Reuse the old way</p>

<ul>
<li>you build modularized PHP or *SP</li>
<li>CSS moved to external files</li>
<li>behavioral code always copied</li>
<li>JS potentially moved to libraries/external files</li>
<li>No re-use previously available for DHTML</li>
</ul>


<p>Widget Reuse the Dojo way</p>

<ul>
<li>build with HTML and CSS fragements</li>
<li>amazingly fast to prototype</li>
<li>look and feel can change w/o changing JS class</li>
<li>automatic reuse:

<ul>
<li>previously everything had to have unique IDS that you managed</li>
<li>Dojo does that counting work for you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Demos</p>

<ul>
<li>Corkboard (from JotSpot)</li>
<li>Turbo DbAdmin</li>
</ul>


<p>Functional Testing</p>

<ul>
<li>LiveTest &#8211; testing the deployed application (part of the Neuvaux
(sp?) project). Only in svn for neuvous (sp?)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the final session of the day I decided to take a lighter one (i.e.
not programming intensive as my mind had been pickled in Ruby code
throughout the day), so I attended Andy Lester&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6826">Preventing Crisis:
Project Estimation and Tracking That
Works</a>. My
notes are below (along with links to the slides/velocity chart). Andy
was introduced by Damian Conway (who was complimenting him on his
practical sensible advice). Everyone hates crisis, problems and the
stress that goes with them. This is how Andy and his team do project
tracking &#8211; it works for them, it may not work for everyone. Will we
make it? How we doing? 190 hours short in example (10 week project). Is
it a crisis or readjustment &#8211; don&#8217;t realize that you&#8217;re screwed until
just before the end. Find out how things are going, early on so they can
be addressed early on. Goals: - accurate schedules (they make customers
happy) - bad news early (surprise makes customers happy) - fun for you
(otherwise, why bother?) Tools &amp; Principles - honesty with everyone -
changes &amp; mistakes happen - tasks are either done or not (no more 90%
done) - nothing is free (get across to customers and self) Assumptions:
- you have version control - backups - bug tracking How to do projects -
Get a project - some sort of written doc (even if you have to write it)
- does it have all of the info you need to do the project? - How
complete? It&#8217;s up to you (think leaflet, not phone book) - Nothing is
set in stone - &#8220;signed off&#8221; on means &#8220;as best we know now&#8221; - changes
will happen, don&#8217;t pretend they won&#8217;t - the requirements establish a
baseline from which work can start - Do a swag - silly wild-assed guess
(spend a day coming up with it, not weeks) - fast &amp; cheap - not a
commitment - estimate in days or weeks - figure out confidence - those
responsible for the work OK the swag - Swag Example: 12 weeks - DB set
up - 1 week - User Screen 1 - 3 weeks - User Screen 2 - 1 week - User
Screen 3 - 2 weeks - Reports - 2 weeks - Admin screens - 2 weeks -
Status web page - 1 week - Do a task list/estimate/schedule - start
breaking up swag - outline form is fine, but not necessary - put them in
chronological order - tasks may not be longer than 4 hours (1/2 day)
Four hours??? - you can&#8217;t estimate accurately above 4 hours -
distributes risk (estimates are usually off by 100% not 10%) - requires
rocks to be turned over - You&#8217;re doing design as you go, so keep notes -
Those responsible for the work OK the task list/schedule (otherwise the
developers will resent mgmt, also serves as a sanity check/peer review
on the task, in case something was missed) Task Breakdown Example - foo
report - 4 days - bar report - 2 days - etc. Task Breakdown Further -
Foo report - data input - 2 hrs - Foo report - data marshalling - 4 hrs
- Foo report - web detail - 3 hrs - etc. &#8220;I might as well write the
thing&#8221; - this is not programming! - the developer thinking about the
tasks is more valuable As you write the code - plan for upcoming weeks -
do one task and complete it - do the next task and complete it - don&#8217;t
jump more than necessary (too much jumping around is bad because you
want chunks of functionality completed in case you need to ship a subset
of the product, i.e. less features, early). Planning for the week -
assign tasks so each person knows what they are doing each day of the
week. - try to assign less than 8 hours of estimated work per person per
day Track progress - keep track of how many hours the task actually took
- don&#8217;t check it off until it&#8217;s actually done - keep track of how long
bug resolution takes as well - re-evaluate remaining tasks if completed
tasks were inaccurate (i.e. they took twice as long). - velocity only
counts those tasks which were completed Tracking the weeks - keep track
of total points (hours) of work remaining (the Sophos guys call this
&#8220;burn down&#8221;) - if missing tasks are discovered, it increases the total
amount of work (moving the &#8220;finish line&#8221; out) and thus the work
remaining won&#8217;t decrease as much - towards the end more bugs will pop-up
and the team&#8217;s velocity will be impacted. - all tasks are binary
(done/not done) - track points completed on a velocity chart - no points
for rework (bug fixes and rework are buying on credit) - don&#8217;t bother
going back and fixing the time estimate for completed tasks, but for
future tasks you should re-evaluate the time estimates (maybe those
tasks need to be broken down into smaller tasks). We want to know about
these types of issues sooner, rather than later. You can&#8217;t be a &#8220;little
pregnant&#8221; - a task is done or not done - I&#8217;m done with that code, I just
need to clean it up &#8211; you&#8217;re not done - I&#8217;m about 90% done with these
tasks &#8211; you&#8217;re not done Adjust - reorder tasks if necessary -
re-estimate and break up tasks if you need to Handle requests - Can do
you X? Yes - How long will it take? I need a day to tell you - Can you
just give me a ballpark? Yes, if I can take a day off of the project to
estimate for you. A non-commital swag is ok here. Slides at <a href="http://petdance.com/perl/crisis.pdf">Preventing

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jim Weirich gave an interesting presentation on dependency injection
entitled, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6473">Dependency Injection: Vitally Important or Completely

Since the slides are available

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why the lucky stiff dazzled the audience with his performance art piece
entitled, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6948">A Starry Afternoon, a Sinking Symphony, and the Polo Champ
Who Gave It All Up for No Reason
Whatsoever</a>.
My mind was blown and my gut busted. O&#8217;Reilly should hold a Monday Night
Extravaganza at next year&#8217;s OSCON and give the entire night to Why (and
his band, The Thirsty Cups). My (very limited) notes are below. This was
an incredible experience including about four different movies (two with
shadow puppets &#8211; yay!) and two live performances by Why and the Thirsty
Cups. First Why extolled the virtues of the future &#8211; such as the
octagonal paper they were using (as seen on Battlestar Gallactica) &#8211;
this octagonal paper has literally changed their lifes (when asked where
one could purchase such fancy paper, Why simply replied, &#8220;The future&#8221;).
After a storytelling session (movie with shadow puppets) and possibly a
musical performance (sorry, so much happened my mind is a blur &#8211; I was
too busy trying to capture it all on film to take accurate notes), Why
noted the dearth of programming resources for children &#8211; claiming that
the only books he could find at Amazon dated from the mid-80&#8217;s (over 20
years ago); unless he was doing the wrong search &#8211; when asked what
&#8220;kids&#8221; are called now-a-days an audience member replied &#8220;gangsters&#8221; (or
was that &#8220;gangstas&#8221;, it was difficult to tell) &#8211; a search for &#8220;gangster
programming&#8221; turned up a single
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387001638/qid=1123213082/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-8580297-7385514?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">book</a>
on Amazon. After that it all become a blur with more movies and another
musical performance. Snapshots from the (pre)-show at FOSCON are here:
http://www.onestepback.org/articles/depinj/index.html Once I get access
to a proper USB cable, I&#8217;ll post my photos to Flickr as well. Also, Why
said that he would post torrents of the movies at his site:
http://redhanded.hobix.com/ What I want to know is when we can purchase
Why and the Thirsty Cups on iTunes &#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Glenn Vanderburg presented on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6816">Metaprogramming
Ruby</a>. I
thought it was quite interesting as I had only done this previously in
ANSI Common Lisp. My notes from the talk are below.</p>

<h2>Metaprogramming (MP)</h2>

<ul>
<li>programming your programming</li>
<li>change the way you program in your programming lang</li>
<li>transform your general-purpose lang</li>
<li>make it domain specific</li>
<li>program ing a lang designed for the problem you&#8217;re solving</li>
</ul>


<p>Lisp</p>

<ul>
<li>origination of metaprog</li>
</ul>


<p>Ruby</p>

<ul>
<li>MP is rediscovered</li>
<li>style and idioms are changing and adapting</li>
<li>rails leverages mp heavily (to great effect)</li>
<li>ruby is a natural for MP</li>
</ul>


<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic and reflective</li>
<li>everything is open to change</li>
<li>blocks allow writing new control structs (add continuations to get
fancy)</li>
<li>Most declarations are executable statements</li>
<li>only slightly less malleable than Lisp (no macros)</li>
<li>a fantastic syntax

<ul>
<li>neutral and unobtrusive</li>
<li>enough to distinguish different kinds of constructs</li>
<li>not enough to complicate straightforward statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Built-in Examples</p>

<ul>
<li>declaring object properties: attr_reader :id, :age attr_writer
:name attr_accessor :color</li>
<li>These are just methods from Module (not syntax)</li>
<li>How are they written? Unfortunately, in C. Still instructive but
doesn&#8217;t tell you how to do it in Ruby.</li>
</ul>


<p>Mathieu Bouchard&#8217;s X11 Library</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote a DSL which defined the X11 Protocol Spec in a way similar to
the way in which the spec itself was written.</li>
</ul>


<p>Styles Have Changed</p>

<ul>
<li>A DSL was created in similar fashion for the Java Debug Wire
Protocol.</li>
<li>executable protocol spec which could be printed from source</li>
</ul>


<p>Dave Thomas&#8217;s Summer Project</p>

<ul>
<li>RubyConf 2002 &#8220;How I spent my summer vacation&#8221;</li>
<li>Created a DSL which would build objects based on the contents of a
DB or generate the DDL for the database or generate the graph code
for an ER diagram.</li>
</ul>


<p>How to think about metaprogramming</p>

<ul>
<li>Def new constructs for your programming lang</li>
<li>Ok, but constructs to do what?</li>
<li>Whatever your DSL needs to do.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another way to think about it</p>

<ul>
<li>a new bag of tricks for eliminating duplication (and other smells)
from your code</li>
<li>two ways to go about it: write your app and extract (Rails), layout
design first (ActionStep).</li>
</ul>


<p>Conventional Constructs</p>

<ul>
<li>DSLs need: types, literals, declaration, expressions, operators,
statements, control structs</li>
</ul>


<p>Most DSLs also deal with things you don&#8217;t usually find in gp langs</p>

<ul>
<li>context-dependence</li>
<li>commands and sentences</li>
<li>units (unit conversion)</li>
<li>large vocabularies ( sometimes unbounded)</li>
<li>hierarchy</li>
</ul>


<p>Contexts</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Establish a context for a set of statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>constrain those statements to the context</li>
<li>multiple, concise operations on the context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What&#8217;s a context? A scope.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Commands &amp; Sentences</p>

<ul>
<li>multipart, complex statements or declarations</li>
</ul>


<p>field(autoinc, :reg_id, pk)</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s just a method call (optional parens are handy for sentences</li>
<li>First param is a method call: restricts the arguments to predefined
alternatives (prevent errors)</li>
<li>Second param is a symbol: restrict syntax to goo name-like strings</li>
<li>Additional params are method calls:

<ul>
<li>options, constraints</li>
<li>methods return objects that encode constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Units</p>

<ul>
<li>general purpose langs deal with scalars</li>
<li>most DSLs deal with quantities</li>
</ul>


<p>Impl Units</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Classes representing quantities</p>

<ul>
<li>don&#8217;t forget to support math</li>
<li>user operator overloading if it makes sense</li>
<li>may require mixed-based arithmetic (time certainly does)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Next: natural expression</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Large Vocab</p>

<ul>
<li>Roman numerals (Roman.CCXX, Roman.XLII)</li>
<li>Jim Weirich&#8217;s XmlMarkup class (used in Rails):</li>
</ul>


<p>How do you impl large vocabularies?</p>

<ul>
<li>override method_missing</li>
<li>Be careful! Bugs lurk here. Sometimes method missing intercepts
something that really is a name in an outer scope &#8211; it&#8217;s also hard
to find bugs if you misspell a real method name.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hierarchy</p>

<ul>
<li>XmlMarkup again (see slides)</li>
</ul>


<p>How to implement?</p>

<ul>
<li>call from method_missing:</li>
</ul>


<p>You could use instance_eval to avoid typing xm. before every call. But
don&#8217;t. If you make a method call within the block and use
instance_eval, the method is looked up in the wrong context and get a
