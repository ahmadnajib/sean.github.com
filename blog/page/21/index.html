  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">DHH</a> gave a talk entitled <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6356">Ruby on Rails:
Enjoying the Ride of
Programming</a>
at OSCON today. He basically went through the creation of a blogging
web-app, the same as he does in the latest <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/show/RailsAcademy">Rails
movie</a>. He did embellish
it a bit by adding Ajax support and an RSS feed, but unfortunately much
of the time he was moving so fast it was difficult to keep up. Once he
posts the slides and/or demo code online I&#8217;ll provide a link to it.
Update Aug 3, 2005: <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a> has
<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/08/ruby_on_rails_o.shtml">detailed
coverage</a>
of this tutorial. I guess I spent too much time trying to learn Rails
before the tutorial session that I was disappointed that it was so
similar to the latest Rails movie (and when DHH went beyond that he was
having so much fun he sped through validations, Ajax, RSS, etc).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <strong>sold out <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7062">Business for
Geeks</a></strong>
tutorial at OSCON was quite good. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/604">Marc
Hedlund</a> is
an excellent teacher/speaker and the absence of Jason Fried from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37
Signals</a> was hardly missed. Below are my notes
from the session which will have to suffice until the slides are put
online.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t obsess about the idea</li>
<li>The name of your company and your idea will not appeal to everyone</li>
<li>Go with the idea that won&#8217;t leave you alone &#8211; the one so compelling
that you have to do it just so it will stop bothering you.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Format</h2>

<ul>
<li>Side job/Night time (keep your day job to pay your expenses, but be
very careful to never work on your project at your employer or using
their equipment!)</li>
<li>Boot strap. Use your own money or an existing source of revenue
(i.e. consulting) to build your business.</li>
<li>Grants. Many federal and state/local governments have strategic
objectives that they give out grants for.</li>
<li>Funded company (i.e. VC money)</li>
</ul>


<h2>The <em>Business</em> View</h2>

<ul>
<li>Business people don&#8217;t care about your idea/technology</li>
<li>They care about customers/market/competitors/team</li>
<li>When presenting your company, the best way is to compare it to a
similar company (i.e. we expect to our market to be 1/10th the size
of Widget Co&#8217;s)</li>
<li>Distinguish your company from a small set of competitors (i.e. don&#8217;t
say &#8220;we don&#8217;t have any competition&#8221; and don&#8217;t try to compare
yourself to the 20 companies which barely touch your market)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Market Research</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pick. Up. The. Phone.</li>
<li>Ask everyone you can what they think. Discuss the problem you are
trying to solve.</li>
<li>Worry more about misunderstanding the market than secrecy.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and search! Look through the
SEC filings of companies in your market.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Taking the Plunge</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you want to work on this for the next 10 years? (Don&#8217;t expect an
easy/quick exit)</li>
<li>Are you thinking about this night and day?</li>
<li>Do you have a financial cushion (4-6 months of living expenses)?</li>
<li>Are you more excited than afraid?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Team</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start small and only grow when absolutely necessary</li>
<li>Choose people who can perform many different types of jobs</li>
<li>Ensure you agree on the idea, expected outcome, work expectations
and roles</li>
<li>Most co-founders end-up hating eachother, no matter what the outcome</li>
<li>Having support and someone else &#8220;in the boat&#8221; is enormously helpful</li>
</ul>


<h2>Funding Anti-Patterns</h2>

<ul>
<li>too few people (overworked)</li>
<li>too many people (cannot agree)</li>
<li>too close (i.e. friends, spouse, etc)</li>
<li>too far (every decision takes forever)</li>
<li>too similar (skillset, i.e. 3 engineers and no &#8220;phone guy&#8221;)</li>
<li>too different (motivations, expectations)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fundraising</h2>

<ul>
<li>Selling yourself (team) and your company to get an investment</li>
<li>Rule #1: VC&#8217;s don&#8217;t start new companies (they help grow existing
companies from a small number of customers to many customers).</li>
<li>Some sources of initial funding are: customers, consulting, angel
investors, bank loans, government grants, yourself/your family</li>
<li><p>Rule #2: Focus on the business first, not on the funding</p>

<ul>
<li>Build the product</li>
<li>Get users</li>
<li>Make money and don&#8217;t spend it!</li>
<li>Get to break-even</li>
<li>Only then think about your growth plan/VC funding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What does VC money get you?</p>

<ul>
<li>Money, for awhile</li>
<li>Maybe credibility</li>
<li>Maybe good guidance and review</li>
<li>Maybe some introductions &#8230; Always ask VC&#8217;s what customers they
can introduce you to.</li>
<li>Advocates for your company (since they have some skin in the
game)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The trick to getting VC funding is not to need it.</p></li>
<li><p>When do you need VC funding?</p>

<ul>
<li>When you have high (millions $) development costs</li>
<li>When your competitors are VC backed (and then only sometimes)</li>
<li>When you need big partners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Rule #3: No means maybe; Yes means maybe</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait for a better round, if any of the VC&#8217;s are ready go
for it. If you&#8217;re waiting for a bigger/better VC and they pass,
the other VC&#8217;s will find out and pull out of the deal.</li>
<li>Go with the VC who&#8217;s honest and scares you, as opposed to the
one who lies to you to make you feel good (since they&#8217;ll get rid
of you as soon as the deal closes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Rule #4: Funding is a full-time job (takes 4-12 months).</p></li>
<li>Rule #5: VC is a business too:

<ul>
<li>funders != founders / investors != inventors</li>
<li>August and December they all go on vacation, so no deals then.</li>
<li>VC&#8217;s have annual funding quotas so the best time to get meetings
are in September/October.</li>
<li>Have a PPT of 10/15 slides, an executive summary of 2-3 pages
and an introduction to a VC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The First Release</h2>

<ul>
<li>The simplest thing that could possibly work</li>
<li>Make it easy to measure results and then make changes based on those
results</li>
</ul>


<h2>Marketing</h2>

<ul>
<li>The best way to get better business ideas is to understand more
about business in general.</li>
<li>Read the Product Marketing Handbook for Software (link below)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Success or Failure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Success is a sustainable business (except for funded companies)</li>
<li>For funded companies the bar is higher as VC&#8217;s want an exit
strategy, such as IPO or acquisition</li>
<li>Failure is tough: laying people off, personal financial peril, home
stress, loss of investors&#8217; money, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Case Study</h2>

<ul>
<li>GripeJuice: a collaborative bargaining site for customers who
experience bad customer service</li>
<li>Customers can learn how others have successfully resolved their
issues</li>
<li>&#8220;For quality purposes this call may be monitored&#8221; - Skype plug-in so
that people can record their customer service calls to corporations</li>
<li>Unfortunately, there is a very high manual labor cost to the
customer (i.e. recording their phone conversations, entering their
issue progress online, etc)</li>
<li>Perhaps this can be used as a freebie to drive traffic to a
larger/related business</li>
</ul>

<p>Marc also mentioned that the folks at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly</a>
are thinking of holding StartCon, a two-day conference on starting your
own business. If you&#8217;d be interested in something like this you should
contact Marc and let him know who you&#8217;d like to hear speak, what you&#8217;d
be willing to pay and what you expect to get out of it. TAGS: OSCON

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a great <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000581.html">interview with Wil
Shipley</a> at
the <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com">DrunkenBlog</a>, with a nice treat at the
end (a history of UI design for <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious
Library</a>). Wil has his own
<a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/">blog</a> which is geared more towards
programmers &#8211; but the interview isn&#8217;t really about that.</p>

<p>In drunkenbatman&#8217;s interview with Wil they go into why Wil left (or was
asked to leave) <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">The Omni Group</a>; his
founding of Delicious Monster with <a href="http://www.mikematas.com/blog/">Mike
Matas</a> (and Mike&#8217;s decision to leave for
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>); the success of Delicious Library; Wil&#8217;s
troubles with depression; Cocoa programming; and some great advice for
ISV entrepreneurs. It&#8217;s definitely worth the time investment to read it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com">Broadband Reports</a> has an interesting
article up discussing <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/65298">Next-gen
Broadband</a>. At this
point it looks like <a href="http://www.verizon.com">Verizon</a> and the cable co&#8217;s
are in the lead to offer high megabit services (i.e. 100Mbps). In my
neighborhood, the first wave of Verizon contractors has already come
through burying fiber and in response <a href="http://www.cox.com">Cox
Communications</a> has upgraded my cable modem service
(at no additional cost &#8211; though see my notes below for more). It looks
like Verizon isn&#8217;t going to actually hook fiber up to my house until I
order their <a href="http://www.verizon.com/fios/">FiOS</a> service (which I&#8217;m not
likely to do until it is either cheaper or considerably faster than my
cable internet service).</p>

<p>Even though Cox claims they have upgraded my service to 5Mbps down/2Mbps
up, I have not noticed any increase in speed, either way. Apparently
they have not upgraded anything and are just putting a new label on the
existing shared 38Mbps. Hopefully now that DOCSIS 3.0 is mostly
finalized, we&#8217;ll see the equipment hit the streets early next year
(though it would be really nice if <a href="http://www.linksys.com">LinkSys</a>
figured out a way to upgrade my existing cable modem&#8217;s firmware instead
of having to fork over more $ for a new box). At any rate, I&#8217;m looking
forward to the higher speeds, both downstream and upstream.</p>
