  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight the first <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads Reston</a> meeting was held at <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/index.html">Near Infinity Corporation</a>. <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/">Jason Harwig</a> gave an excellent presentation on <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>, starting with a simple browser created completely in Interface Builder (it consisted of a text field linked to a web view). I&#8217;ve recreated it and included a snapshot below.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/basicbrowser.png" title="An Extremely Basic Web Browser" ></p>

<p>Next he demonstrated how to interact with the DOM and JavaScript. The JavaScript integration was in both directions, first he demonstrated calling JavaScript functions from Objective-C and then calling Objective-C from JavaScript. It should be noted that for JavaScript to call Objective-C you need to implement the <code>+ (BOOL)isSelectorExcludedFromWebScript:(SEL)aSelector;</code> method and return <code>NO</code> for each of the methods you wish to call.</p>

<p>Finally, Jason walked through various uses of WebKit an demonstrated an application specific, full-screen browser he wrote for a game as well as a del.icio.us Cocoa application he wrote called <a href="http://pinepointsoftware.com/delish/site/">Delish</a>. Several other webkit based applications were also covered such as <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid</a> - a freely available site-specific browser creator, <a href="http://infinitenil.com/packrat/">PackRat</a> - a commercial site-specific browser for Backpack, and another application which I&#8217;ve forgotten (I guess I should&#8217;ve taken notes). As an aside, Jason brought up the interesting work that the <a href="http://280north.com/">280North</a> folks have done for their <a href="http://280slides.com/">280Slides</a> web-based presentation called <a href="http://objective-j.org/">Objective-J</a>. Objective-J (code named Cappuccino), is an Objective-C like language built on JavaScript.</p>

<p>Matt Wizeman stepped up next to demo a WebKit application he&#8217;s developing to wrap a troublesome time tracking web application. It was interesting the machinations he had to go through to know when the page had finished loading and to transition between pages since the application was JavaScript heavy, using tricks like clickable divs.</p>

<p>I learned quite a bit about WebKit. As soon as I got home I was energized to play with it.</p>

<p>Be sure to come to the next meeting on July 10th (day before iPhone 3G day)!</p>

of yesterday&#8217;s storm</a> here in Northern, VA.
For about half-an-hour yestersay, the folks at work milled around in
interior offices, hallways, and the stairwell while my family at home
hid out in the basement. Thankfully there were not much damage in my
neighborhood, though I saw several fallen trees on homes during my
commute home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> says, &#8220;The best reason to
learn a new programming language is to learn to think differently.&#8221; Here
in Northern VA, we have a new opportunity to think differently with the
introduction of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">NoVA Languages
group</a>. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/voodootikigod">Chris
Williams</a> from <a href="http://www.iterativedesigns.com/">Iterative
Designs</a> posted to the <a href="http://novarug.org/">NoVA
RUG</a> mailing list this morning and received quite a
bit of interest. Here&#8217;s what he has to say about the new group:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thoughts on the makeup of the group include obtaining (however you
want) a book, working through the book 1 chapter per week on one night
of that week with a group of like minded individuals.</p></blockquote>

<p>To start, the group will work through Joe Armstrong&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang">Programming
Erlang</a> book
starting on Monday, June 16th (hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to work out a
schedule with my wife so I can attend). This is an excellent choice on
several levels: every developer should know a functional programming
language; single core processors are increasingly rare and the number of
cores in commodity hardware should only increase in the coming years;
and I already own the book.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> doesn&#8217;t pique your interest, the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nscodernightdc">NSCoderNight DC</a> group
is going to work through the 3rd Edition of <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Aaron
Hillegass&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS
X</a>
book on Tuesday nights. For several months now, I&#8217;ve been playing around
with Cocoa and while I&#8217;m getting used to the syntax of Objective-C, the
XCode IDE and Interface Builder still seem foreign to me (I never liked
IDEs having been weened on Emacs).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great time to be a programmer in Northern Virginia!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It turns out that there&#8217;s another Cocoa group right around
the corner from me in Reston:
<a href="http://www.cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html">CocoaHeads</a>.
They meet the second Thursday of each month.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://refresh-dc.org/"><img src="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/refreshdc.png" alt="Refresh
DC" /></a></p>

<p>Tonight I had the opportunity to attend a special <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/">Refresh
DC</a> meeting on the challenges of starting your
own business. The format was a panel of folks from the DC startup scene
moderated by <a href="http://www.viget.com/about/team/jwilkinson">Jackson
Wilkinson</a> of <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget
Labs</a>. The panel consisted of <a href="http://www.viget.com/about/team/bwilliams">Brian
Williams</a> of Viget Labs,
<a href="http://andrewlee.com/">Andrew Lee</a> of <a href="http://publi.us/">Publi.us</a>,
Eric Rupert from <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a>, <a href="http://blog.hungrymachine.com/">Eddie
Frederick</a>of <a href="http://hungrymachine.com/">Hungry
Machine</a>, and <a href="http://www.launchboxdigital.com/blog.html">Sean
Greene</a> of <a href="http://www.launchboxdigital.com/">LaunchBox
Digital</a>.</p>

<p>These were the main points I took away:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Be passionate.</strong> The most important quality for startup founders
is to be passionate about their product or service. Starting a
company can be exhilarating but the setbacks can be really
difficult. If you&#8217;re not passionate about what you&#8217;re doing each of
these roadblocks will be an excuse for you to quit. Figure out what
you&#8217;re passionate about and work on that.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on your product.</strong> Don&#8217;t focus on the pie-in-the-sky
potential valuations of your company or worry about leasing office
space, hiring an attorney, finding an accountant, etc. Instead you
should focus on the product or service you&#8217;re going to sell. Get
something out there quickly &#8211; pick the most important feature and
get it out there in front of your customers quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Have your customers influence your product.</strong> If you follow the
previous advice and get your product out there quickly you can use
customer feedback to iterate your product. You may not know all of
the difference ways customers will use your product, so this
feedback is critical in charting your product roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Equity is control, don&#8217;t surrender it easily.</strong> One of the
attendees asked about using equity to pay for services if money was
tight. Brian said to avoid giving out equity as you make that person
a partner in your business. While they may not have a controlling
interest, they are still an owner and have some influence.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t overfund.</strong> All of the panelists warned of the dangers of
taking too much money as it does more than dilute the founders&#8217;
ownership. Venture capitalists are looking to make a large return o
their capital for themselves and their limited partners. If you need
to pay a vendor or contractor find another way &#8211; defer payment, use
credit, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Hire slow, fire fast.</strong> Early employees can make or break your
company. You will be working long hours aside these folks so you
must ensure they&#8217;re a good fit. If you make a bad hire, you need to
resolve the situation quickly, don&#8217;t let emotion get in the way.</li>
</ol>


<p>Some of the books recommended were: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting/dp/1591840562/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209008603&amp;sr=8-1">Art of the
Start</a>,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209008634&amp;sr=8-2">Getting to
Yes</a>,
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1590597141/ref=pd_bbs_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209008603&amp;sr=8-3">Founders at
Work</a>.
Andrew also recommended <a href="http://startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> run
by <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> (YC). I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul
Graham</a>&#8217;s essays for around seven years now
and following YC&#8217;s investments. I&#8217;m glad to see an early stage investor
like YC in the DC area (LaunchBox Digital) and hope that the startup
scene in DC and suburbs becomes more vibrant.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.sainc.com/">Strategic Analysis</a> for hosting this.
It was a great venue and hope they&#8217;ll offer to host Refresh DC again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently at work I spent a few weeks tuning a network service across
three platforms (Solaris, Linux, and AIX) to get within 10% of the
theoretical maximum throughput. In this short article, I&#8217;ll walk through
the various tools I used to improve the performance of the application.</p>

<p>This application is very specialized in that the two machines are
connected directly through an ethernet switch. This means that the MTU
could easily be determined from each end of the link and the extra work
to determine the maximum segment size for the transit network (see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1191">RFC
1191</a>) was unnecessary. This also
made it very easy to watch the traffic between the two hosts as well as
the system calls they were using to transfer and receive the data.</p>

<p>Before I get into the steps I took to tune the service, I&#8217;d like to
introduce the tools used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Truss: a tracing utility which displays system calls, dynamically
loaded user level function calls, received signals, and incurred
machine faults. This is available for many platforms, but I use it
most on AIX.</li>
<li>DTrace/DTruss: a dynamic tracing compiler and tracing utility. This
is an amazingly powerful tool from Sun, originally for Solaris but
slowly spreading to other platforms. See Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/howtoguides/dtracehowto.jsp">How To
Guide</a>.</li>
<li>strace: a dynamic tracing utility which displays systems calls and
received signals under Linux.</li>
<li>mpstat: collects and displays performance statistics for all logical
CPUs in the system.</li>
<li>prstat: iteratively examines all active processes on the system and
reports statistics based on the selected output mode and sort order.</li>
<li>tcpdump: a utility for capturing network traffic.</li>
<li>Wireshark: a network protocol analyzer. It replaces the venerable
Ethereal tool and allows you to either capture network traffic on
demand or load a captured session for analysis. Find out more
<a href="http://www.wireshark.org">here</a>.</li>
<li>gprof: a tool for profiling your code to determine where the
performance bottle-necks are. See the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/manual/gprof-2.9.1/html_mono/gprof.html">manual</a>
for more information.</li>
<li>c++filt: a tool for demangling C++ method names. It is part of the
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/project/binutils/">GNU binutils package</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I already had the service up and running, I simply ran the two
components and captured the traffic between them using tcpdump. While
the processes were running, I also used dtruss, truss, or strace
(depending on the platform) to capture the system calls being made.
Since this is a network service, I focused on calls to <code>select</code>, <code>send</code>,
and <code>recv</code>.</p>

<pre><code>13455/15:   2143177    2994      4 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB910, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDBA30) = 1 0
13455/15:   2143180       5      0 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB8D0, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDB9F0) = 1 0
13455/15:   2143185       8      4 recvfrom(0x11, 0xB384A0, 0x10000)                    = 1416 0
13455/15:   2143253       5      0 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB8D0, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDB9F0) = 0 0
13455/15:   2143262      12      8 send(0x11, 0xB084D0, 0x14B8)                         = 5304 0
13455/15:   2143268     365      4 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB910, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDBA30) = 1 0
13455/15:   2143270       4      0 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB8D0, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDB9F0) = 1 0
13455/15:   2143275       8      4 recvfrom(0x11, 0xB384A0, 0x10000)                    = 1416 0
13455/15:   2143343       5      0 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB8D0, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDB9F0) = 0 0
13455/15:   2143348       9      4 send(0x11, 0xB084D0, 0x14B8)                         = 5304 0
13455/15:   2143353    1000      4 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBADDB910, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBADDBA30) = 1 0
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the results above you can see that <code>select</code> (<code>pollsys</code>) is
being called each time we need to send or receive data over the network.
Since the socket is non-blocking we can rely on the immediate return
when the outgoing socket buffer is full as well as when there is no data
available to read. By <code>select</code>ing at the very top of the receive loop we
can bundle multiple receive calls together, increasing the application&#8217;s
throughput. Now the output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>16712/9:     16202    1560      6 pollsys(0xFFFFFD7EBB9DB940, 0x1, 0xFFFFFD7EBB9DBA30) = 1 0
16712/9:     16217      10      6 recv(0xB, 0x8A6450, 0x10000)                         = 1416 0
16712/9:     16246       9      5 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16267       7      3 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16285       5      1 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16680      10      5 recv(0xB, 0x8A6450, 0x10000)                         = 1416 0
16712/9:     16712      11      7 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16733       7      3 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16753       6      2 send(0xB, 0x876480, 0x540)                           = 1344 0
16712/9:     16768       4      0 recv(0xB, 0x8A6450, 0x10000)                         = -1 Err#11
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that now we are able to process two requests and send out
six responses in the time that it previously took to call select and
receive a single request. When there is nothing left to read, the call
to <code>recv</code> returns errno 11 (<code>EAGAIN</code>). This change made the single
biggest performance impact on the code. I also changed the calls
<code>recvfrom</code> to <code>recv</code> since the application did not make use of the
foreign address.</p>

<p>At this point the performance was much better but I noticed that under
heavy load the sending socket would block as the ratio of requests to
responses was 1:3. As this was a UDP application, having the sending
buffers fill up seemed strange as we assumed that additional packets
would simply be dropped on the floor.</p>

<p>On the server, I checked the UDP socket buffer size using <code>ndd</code> (this
was under Solaris. For AIX the command is <code>no</code> and for Linux the command
is <code>sysctl</code>).</p>

<p>The following code was added to the socket initialize (minus the error
handling) to ensure that the socket buffers were large enough.</p>

<pre><code>unsigned size = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
int ret = setsockopt(desc, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, &amp;size, sizeof(size));
    ret = setsockopt(desc, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &amp;size, sizeof(size));
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the application was performing acceptably I decided to run it
under the profiler. This turned up the function which was adding
responses to the in-memory packet. It turned out that as responses were
being added to the packet, the headers were being recalculated each
time. I removed this unnecessary work and only made the calculations
right before the packet was sent. This improved performance a few
percentage points more.</p>

<p>By binding the network interrupts to a particular core and keeping the
sending thread off of that core we were able to eek out additional
performance from the application. To accomplish this, the application
allows the operator to specify which core(s) it should bind to using
<code>sched_setaffinity</code> (Linux) and <code>processor_bind</code> (Solaris). You can also
accomplish this using <code>taskset</code> (Linux) and pbind (Solaris) if you don&#8217;t
wish to modify your application.</p>

<p>Looking at the network traffic with tcpdump, I saw that I could fit an
additional response in the response bundle packet if I reduced or
removed some of the items in the packet header. At this point the
analysis and tuning had gone on for a few weeks and we had a schedule to
meet. Since the performance was where we needed it, the application was
wrapped up and sent to quality assurance.</p>

<p>The single most important lesson I learned from this exercise was to use
non-blocking sockets to their fullest by continually calling
<code>recv</code>/<code>send</code> until the call would block and then using <code>select</code> to idle
the process until there is work to do.</p>
