  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend <a href="http://blacka.com/david/">Dave</a> <del>is</del> was looking to get an
<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> now that his <a href="http://blacka.com/david/archives/2007/07/the-irony/">Treo
died</a>. I already
have AT&amp;T service and I&rsquo;d love to upgrade to an iPhone as well. Being an
old AT&amp;T Wireless customer from before they were purchased by Cingular
and renamed (and now back to the old name) does not appear to be an
asset. I&rsquo;ve had the service before I was married, consequently if I&rsquo;m
going to upgrade my phone, consolidating my service with my wife&rsquo;s
through <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/easysetup/rateplans.html">AT&amp;T&rsquo;s family
plan</a> would
probably be best for us. Thus I called up AT&amp;T to see if they could
assist me. Unfortunately, my service is through the national business
accounts arm of the company and the family plan is not an option there.
I have no problem being switched off of the national business accounts
(and forgoing my monthly discount), but their system won&rsquo;t let them
convert my account. I can leave AT&amp;T and go to another service provider,
taking my number with me but I cannot stay with AT&amp;T and switch to the
family plan. If I leave to go to another carrier, taking my number with
me, and then go back to AT&amp;T, I&rsquo;ll still be stuck on the national
business accounts side of the house. The service representative said she
could set me up with a completely new account (i.e. new phone numbers)
with the family plan. I explained that I&rsquo;ve had my cell number for a
decade now and I&rsquo;m not going to change it. I&rsquo;m willing to pay them more
money (almost double what I pay now) and purchase one (possibly even
two) expensive handsets and they cannot help me out at all. This is
completely insane! AT&amp;T really needs to get its act together and
integrate its back office systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/pbarnett.png" title="Paul Barnett"><img src="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/pbarnett.thumbnail.png" alt="Paul
Barnett" /></a></p>

<p>Last week, I was fortunate enough to be one of the few folks who
attended the <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/igda_dc_chapter/">Northern
VA</a>
<a href="http://www.idga.org/cgi-bin/templates/single.html?topic=329">IGDA</a>
meeting where <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/behindTheScenes/meetTheTeam/paulBarnett.php">Paul
Barnett</a>
spoke to us about <em>desire</em>. Specifically what you can and cannot control
to influence your customers into buying your product (in his case a
subscription to a MMORPG). That is, to make them <em>desire</em> your product.
To warm up he spoke about the utility of mind maps and suggested reading
Tony Buzan&rsquo;s book on Mind Maps. While speaking about mind maps, he
hinted at the mind map he drew on the board in preparation for his talk.
As background, for those who may not know what <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/">Warhammer: Age of
Reckoning</a> (WAR) is, Paul explained
that it is <strong>not</strong> a computer game. As Paul sees it, computer games are
like &ldquo;washing powder&rdquo; (laundry detergent) in that it is a product which
is made, shipped and forgotten about. Next week there is always a better
version of washing powder on the market (new, improved, etc), to the
point where it seems like just weeks ago we were essentially washing our
clothes in dirt. WAR, in contrast, is a hobby game. As a hobby game it
requires skill, commitment and imagination. Hobbies are
self-obsessed/self-indulgent; a very personal endeavor. And WAR is not
just a game that is shipped and forgotten. Since it is a massively
multiplayer online game, the developers must constantly work to improve
the game while the customer service team resolves issues and others work
to lead in-game special events. EA Mythic is providing an experience
with WAR (as is Blizzard with World of Warcraft, aka WoW). Getting back
to the topic of the evening, Paul spoke of the three thwarts to your
product:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Acts of God</strong>. These are causes that you have no control over, so
you shouldn&rsquo;t try to overcome them. Examples included loss of
internet, loss of life, bankruptcy, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Your own fault</strong>. These are causes that you have total control
over which you can mitigate with planning, investment and training.
Examples included unstable code/servers, bad download experience,
bad customer service, bad install experience, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Not any good</strong>. These are causes that you have control over which
are extremely difficult to mitigate. You cannot just plan to have a
good game or invest in a good game. This is extremely subjective,
what one person thinks is great someone else may believe to be total
crap. Examples included balancing the game, making it engaging,
building a sense of community, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/board.jpg" title="board.jpg"><img src="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/board.thumbnail.jpg" alt="board.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built-up desire for your product you have to maintain it.
Paul stated that desire is eroded at audit points. Audit points are
times when the customer takes stock of their experience and consciously
chooses to continue paying you money or not. He compared audit points to
the form of interrogation where-by a person&rsquo;s head is held under water
for a period of time and then pulled out &mdash; those points when the person
comes up gasping for air are audit points. You have to keep people away
from audit points. Each of the thwarts mentioned above cause audit
points. Thus when you balance (or nerf) the game, you&rsquo;ve just changed
the user&rsquo;s experience and thus inserted an audit point. In addition,
when you release an expansion pack or a patch, it causes an audit point
as the user must choose whether or not to go out and purchase the
expansion pack which allows them access to new locations/adventures
taking them out of their comfort zone within the game. That&rsquo;s all well
and good, but how do you actually build desire for your product in the
first place? Paul believes that you must plan and invest in several
areas prior to the launch of your product. You should have transparent
communication from the very beginning (see <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/behindTheScenes/vidPhoneDiaries/index.php">Paul&rsquo;s video
blog</a>
along with <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/behindTheScenes/developmentDiaries/index.php">developer
interviews/podcasts</a>
and other behind the scenes material). You also need to build a sense of
community so that your customers and prospective customers feel part of
a greater whole. In this regard, EA Mythic has created <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/community/fansiteKit/">kits for fan
sites</a>,
<a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/community/forumsFansites/">forums</a>
on their website, special <a href="http://www.warhammeronline.com/english/community/eventsCalendar/">promotional
events</a>
and materials, etc. Another way to build desire is to ensure that your
product provides a sense of progression. This is very similar to the
notions espoused by <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy
Sierra</a> around
helping your users kick ass. At the end of his talk, Paul mentioned the
&lsquo;innovator&rsquo;s dilemma&rsquo;, specifically evolution vs. revolution. He
estimated that new products can only support 2-3 innovations per
release, any more would simply overwhelm the market. For a product like
his, he gave examples like a unique HUD, unique control scheme,
completely different questing system, etc. In a related vein, he spoke
about &lsquo;crossing the chasm&rsquo;, loosely related to Geoffrey Moore&rsquo;s book
which discusses bridging the gap between the early adopters and the
early majority (the pragmatists). Paul&rsquo;s example was that of setting for
the game, fantsy vs. science fiction. His argument was that people can
relate to better to a fantasy world as everyone knows about cutting
enemies down with swords or clubbing them but shooting blaster cannons
or instaneous space travel, which don&rsquo;t exist in real life, take more of
a leap. Personally, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the reason why most Sci-Fi MMOs
are having a difficult time but he&rsquo;s certainly entitled to his opinion.
Overall, Paul&rsquo;s talk was quite enjoyable (in no small part to his
bitingly sarcastic British humor) and he has definitely made some
interesting observations, though it would seem that many are widely
known outside of the &ldquo;game development&rdquo; community. I look forward to
hearing more from Paul and the team at EA Mythic and will be keeping an
eye on the development of WAR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on a comment from an alert reader, I found out that the link was
broken in my <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/04/14/ajax-spy-in-rails/">Ajax Spy in
Rails</a> post.
Since I couldn&rsquo;t locate the original zip file on my powerbook, I rewrote
it from scratch using Rails 1.2.3 with REST/CRUD and then updated the
link at the end of that post. To save you time, you can download the
source from
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/spy.zip">here</a> as
well. This (and the prior) version simply uses a timer to periodically
call back to the server to see if there were any updates, which places
an unnecessarily heavy load on your server. A better approach would be
to use something like <a href="http://juggernaut.rubyforge.org/">Juggernaut</a> to
push updates out to clients. I&rsquo;m investigating Juggernaut now for use in
my Ajax Rails game &mdash; I&rsquo;ll post more once I have a demo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tonight we held the April meeting of the Northern VA RUG. <a href="http://www.cris.com/~raydaly/">Ray
Daly</a> presented RSS and novel uses for it
while <a href="http://paul.stadig.name">Paul Stadig</a> discussed various methods
of screen scraping. Ray provided an overview of RSS, examples of
widespread usage (news feeds, monitoring, podcasts, etc) and then spoke
about how RSS could be used to tie together disparate systems. He
wrapped up with a Rails demo showing how to create RSS feeds and a brief
discussion of the available libraries for creating and consuming
RSS/Atom. Paul&rsquo;s presentation on screen scraping started with a
discussion of why you&rsquo;d want to gather data in this way (most of the
interesting data lies in the &lsquo;deep web&rsquo; where there is no API/RSS to
extract the data easily). He then gave an overview, with example code,
of N tecniques: POOR (Plain Old
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/URI.html">Open-URI</a> and RegExps),
POOH (Plain Old
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/URI.html">Open-URI</a> and

<a href="http://scrubyt.org/">scRUBYt</a>, <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">WATIR</a> and

<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/07/11/scraping-with-style-scrapi-toolkit-for-ruby/">scrAPI</a>.
Of the examples shown, Hpricot looks like an excellent HTML parser
(though it does require native code) while scRUBYt and scrAPI seem to
have the most promise for making screen scraping easy to do. His slides
are

<p>Tonight we had the March meeting of the Northern VA Ruby Users Group.
First up was Douglas Sellers who talked about
<a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-on-rails">Selenium on
Rails</a>. After a short break, I
spoke about RESTful Rails (focusing on CRUD, REST and ActiveResource).</p>

<p>Doug provided us with an excellent overview of Selenium core and went in
to how to install and configure it (hint: it&rsquo;s as simple as downloading
and unzipping it into your public web root directory). He then went into
the steps involved in manually creating tests and test suites and how it
gets tedious very quickly (as you&rsquo;re writing HTML tables). To make the
development tester&rsquo;s job much easier he walked through the same test
using Selenium on Rails which allows you to use Ruby to generate your
tests. Doug&rsquo;s slides are available
<a href="http://novarug.org/douglas_sellers_selenium_presentation.ppt">here</a>. I
ended up rushing through my slides and didn&rsquo;t enunciate well so the
listener experience was pretty bad, I&rsquo;m sure. I need to relax when
presenting and slow down. Still, I think that the content stands on its
own and many folks seemed interested in my sample application for
managing users groups. You can download the PDF-ized slides
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/restful-rails.pdf">here</a>
and once I get the subversion repository setup, you&rsquo;ll be able to view
and checkout the source code
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rugomatic/">here</a>. Also, here are the two
scripts I followed for the demo:
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/rest-script.txt">REST</a>
and
<a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/ares-script.txt">ActiveResource</a>.</p>
