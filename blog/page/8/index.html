I&#8217;ve been looking for a good introductory book on
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> for quite awhile now. Unfortunately,
the Concurrent Programming in Erlang book just doesn&#8217;t do it for me
(plus only the first part is available online). Thankfully, it looks
like the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> have
come through with <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html">Programming
Erlang</a>.</p>

I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/shows/venturebros/">The Venture
Bros.</a> since I found out
about them over lunch during my interview at EA Mythic. I think that the
series is quite funny and have been enjoying it ever since I first heard
about it. Though I have seen reviews on the &#8216;net which complain that the
show is infantile, others compare it to <em>South Park</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em>
as well as <em>Johnny Quest</em>. The last comparison is apt as that is where
Venture Brothers draws its inspiration, though all aspects of popular
culture are referenced in the shows. My personal favorite episode thus
far is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Years_to_Midnight">Twenty Years to
Midnight</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night we had excellent turn-out at the <a href="http://www.novarug.org">Northern VA Ruby Users
Group</a>. <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/ruby/index.html">Rich
Kilmer</a> gave an
enlightening talk on Domain Specific Languages and <a href="http://twifkak.com/">Devin
Mullins</a> delivered an interesting performance piece
on Rails plugins where he wrote code while singing about it (ensuring
that the code matched his meter and rhyme). Rich&#8217;s presentation was very
similar to his <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/01/25/january-novarug-meeting">previous
presentation</a>
on the DSL he wrote for the <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBT/is_3_57/ai_74407415">Coronet refueling
missions</a>
for the USAF. He began by giving a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">definition of
DSL</a>
(from <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a>) and then speaking
about External and Internal DSLs. Since the focus of his talk was on
internal DSLs written in Ruby he provided a further division between
explicit and implicit DSLs. His example of an explicit DSL was:</p>

<pre><code>when_shopping do |store| 

  store.buy :popcorn 

  store.buy :soda 

end
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice in the explicit case the syntax of Ruby is clearly visible
and a store object is created which the buy method is invoked upon. Here
is his example of an implicit DSL:</p>

<pre><code>when_shopping { 

  buy :popcorn 

  buy :soda 

}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the code is more declarative: when shopping buy popcorn
and soda. Rich appeared to prefer the latter form. He did show an issue
with the implicit form when attempting to access member variables like
so:</p>

<pre><code>extend ShoppingTrip::Behavior 

@amount = 6  

when_shopping { 

  buy :popcorn 

  buy :soda, @amount 

}
</code></pre>

<p>This code won&#8217;t work because the block is invoked in the scope of the
ShoppingTrip instance where there is no @amount variable. The explicit
DSL doesn&#8217;t have this problem. When Rich makes his slides available,
I&#8217;ll update this post to point to them. Devin walked through the
creation of a Rails plugin while singing about what he was typing to the
tune of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_of_the_Hours">&#8220;Dance of the
Hours&#8221;</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amilcare_Ponchielli">Ponchielli</a>. He
showed how you can extend your models using plugins and went through
some of the files created when running script/generate plugin. Tonight,
we also had <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> as a guest. It was
nice to finally meet him in person, though I didn&#8217;t get much of a chance
to speak with him as he was quite popular with the other attendees. He
did mention that he&#8217;s left <a href="http://www.naviance.com/">Naviance</a> and is
providing training and consulting services. Hopefully when I attend <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/therailsedge/">The
Rails Edge</a> in January I&#8217;ll be
able to chat with him some more. I also had the pleasure of meeting
<a href="http://www.luisdelarosa.com/">Luis de la Rosa</a> who took the plunge and
went indie (though he&#8217;s supporting himself primarily through consulting,
which I don&#8217;t call &#8216;indie&#8217;). But I&#8217;m rooting for him and hope he does
well&#8211;I tried the contractor route very briefly after my break with
Cisco and I can say I just don&#8217;t have the stomach for it (plus I&#8217;m the
sole provider for my family and the uncertainty was just too much
stress). I&#8217;d definitely like to improve my ObjC/Cocoa skills and look
forward to the next
<a href="http://cocoadevhouse.org/wiki/index.php/Main/CocoaDevHouseWashington">CocoaDevHouse</a>
(that Luis will help organize). Next month at NoVA RUG we&#8217;ll have
presentations on Rails deployment and Selenium.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I participated in a &#8220;code fest&#8221; sponsored by my employer. It
was great fun and the code fest was powered by
<a href="http://www.topcoder.com">TopCoder</a>. This was my first time
participating in any sort of coding competition and while I didn&#8217;t make
the top three, I did place in the top ten. I&#8217;m definitely looking
forward to the next company sponsored event in February. For those of
you not familiar with TopCoder, they basically provide a Java
application/applet called the Competition Arena. Once you login to the
arena, you can then register for a Single Round Match (SRM, in TopCoder
parlance), but only during the registration window (which appears to be
two hours prior to the event). Once the event begins you have 75 minutes
to solve problems of increasing difficulty. Each problem set is assigned
a certain number of points (usually 250, 500 and 1000). You are judged
both on the correctness of your program as well as the time it took you
to develop and test it. Since you must develop, compile and test your
code in TopCoder&#8217;s arena Java app you can only write your solution in
C++, Java, C#, or VisualBasic. I wish they offered Ruby as an option
(or even Python), but at this time you&#8217;re stuck with those four choices.
You are allowed to choose your programming language at the problem set
level (i.e. you don&#8217;t need to stick with the same language for all
three). Since the majority of my experience in the past ten years has
been with Java I selected that for all three of the problem sets. In
retrospect, I might&#8217;ve fared better had I chosen C++ as that is what
I&#8217;ve been using almost exclusively at work these past three months. I
also need to manage my time better as I ran out of time just before I
was going to submit my solution to the 1000 point problem&#8211;I believe
that had I finished in time, I would&#8217;ve placed in the top three (I guess
we&#8217;ll see when I participate in February). Once the content ends, you&#8217;re
able to look at the solutions from the other participants and can
challenge their solutions if you believe you&#8217;ve found a bug. If your
challenge succeeds, you earn points and the person challenged loses all
of the points for that problem, but if your challenge fails, you&#8217;ll lose
points and the person challenged will gain points. There were a few
successful and unsuccessful challenges during the competition. Looking
through people&#8217;s code it was clear that the folks who had participated
previously didn&#8217;t bother indenting their code properly or ensuring it
was clear&#8211;they focused on getting it working in the shortest time
possible. I made the newbie mistake of properly indenting my code and
even writing psudocode comments as an outline prior to writing the real
code (next time I&#8217;ll do this on paper if necessary). I also was hampered
slightly by the Arena editor as it uses the MS Windows keybindings even
on the Mac! Thus CTRL+C is copy instead of CMD+C &#8211; I kept hitting the
Apple shortcuts instead of their Windows counterparts and this slowed me
down as well. My colleague suggested just keeping Emacs open and copy
and paste as necessary into the Arena editor. Unfortunately, I cannot
post the problem sets here as they are copyrighted by TopCoder and you
must have permission to republish them. But if you go to the TopCoder
site, you can see many example problems. If you&#8217;re interested in
petitioning TopCoder to offer Ruby as an alternative language for
competitions, I urge you to <a href="mailto:service@topcoder.com">email them</a>,
as I have. <strong>Update 2006-12-21</strong>: I received the following response from
TopCoder and have asked them to add Ruby as an option for &#8220;Marathon
Matches&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>We do not allow interpreted languages like Python or Ruby in our
algorithm events because their execution speeds makes them
non-competitive compared to the other languages.Â We revisit this from
time to time, but our tests have shown that the execution speed makes
writing problems that keep all languages on the same approximate
playing field impossible. We do offer Python as a fully supported
language choice in our Marathon Match events, where we can relax the
constraints because of the non time-critical nature of the event.Â You
can find more information about Marathon events on our web site under
â€œMarathon Matchesâ€?</p></blockquote>
