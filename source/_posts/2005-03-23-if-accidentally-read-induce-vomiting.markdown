[Will this madness never
end?](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60931-2005Mar23.html)
I'm sick of the fight over MCI already. MCI is right in my backyard and
I'm sure there are a lot of good people working there, but the company
is still in shambles. They [lost $32M in the most recent
quarter](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/050225/earns_mci_7.html), Capellas
doesn't appear to have a compelling story for where MCI is headed and
seems to want to wash his hands of the mess by cashing out. Though, I
suppose if that were really the case, he'd take the Qwest offer since
it's materially higher.

I'm surprised that Qwest is still fighting for MCI, they obviously want
the $5B cash which comes with the acquisition (I guess they'll figure
out some creative way of dealing with almost $5B in debt), but whoever
ends up with MCI will be in for a real headache. Even [MCI's chief
strategist acknowledges that they are running out of
time](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/09/business/09phone.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1107964901-1RRtUt6bgCC2Kj/D4Q/tSA).

I enjoyed Om's comparison of Seidenberg and Notebaert to [Grumpy Old
Men](http://www.gigaom.com/2005/03/22/grumpy-old-telecoms/), I think
it's apt. Though at least Lemmon and Matthau were fighting over Ann
Margret, not some failing, non-prize of a company. The best thing for VZ
and Q shareholders would be for both companies to walk away and leave
MCIP to sort out its own problems.
