[37signals](http://37signals.com) have announced their latest project
[Backpack](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/2005/03/backpack_whats.php)
(which was codenamed Honey). Since it hasn't launched yet, details are
thin. But I believe that this will fit nicely in between their current
offerings: the free [Ta-da List](http://tadalist.com/) and their popular
[Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/) project management tool.

[DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000429.html) states that

> *Backpack helps you bring life's loose ends together*

DHH also mentions in that same post that Backpack was the reason for
adding the ability to receive (as well as send) email to the
ActionMailer portion of [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/).

So I'm guessing it's a psuedo-project management tool for the home user.
Useful for tracking tasks and their associated people, actions, etc.
Basically, the ultimate personal information manager (PIM) to help you
gather your email, contacts, schedules, notes, documents and more in one
central location. We'll just have to wait the month-or-so until it
officially launches to find out for certain.
