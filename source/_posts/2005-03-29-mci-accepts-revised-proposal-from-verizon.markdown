Well, it looks like this sordid mess is finally over: [MCI Accepts
Revised Proposal From
Verizon](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/03-29-2005/0003288556&EDATE=).
Though I think that looking back on this it would've been much smarter
for VZ to allow Qwest to buy MCI and simply wait to purchase the assets
out of bankruptcy. I predict that this acquisition will not be accretive
for VZ.
