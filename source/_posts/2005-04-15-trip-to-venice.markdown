Pictures from my weekend trip to Venice are on-line. Unfortunately, I've
exceeded the limit on my free flickr account so not all of the pictures
are up yet. Once I get it sorted out, I'll put the remainder up.\

 I had a great time in Venice, though it would've been nice to bring the
family. That just means we'll have to go back. \
