It appears that Verizon has announced the limited availability of
['Naked'
DSL](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050418/ap_on_hi_te/verizon_dsl)
(via Yahoo! News) in the Northeast. Unfortunately it is not clear from
the story that this roll-out is only for existing Verizon customers who
which to switch their phone service while keeping their Verizon DSL. But
I guess it's a good start. Actually I'm still waiting for Verizon to
notify me that [FioS (FTTH)](http://www.verizonfios.com/) is available
-- it was [mentioned in the local
paper](http://observernews.com/stories/current/news/021105/fiber.shtml)
that this would take place during April.
