It looks like the Beta for [Rojo](http://www.rojo.com/) has finally
ended. I've been using the on-line news reader for several weeks now.
Unfortunately, there is something about it that I just don't like.
Perhaps I'm spoiled by [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/)
and other client-side applications. I think the idea of sharing
interesting feeds among your friends/contacts is a good one and the new
site-layout is much improved from when I first joined the beta. I guess
I just prefer client-side apps for news reading -- this is why I never
really got into [Kinja](http://kinja.com/). Oh well.
