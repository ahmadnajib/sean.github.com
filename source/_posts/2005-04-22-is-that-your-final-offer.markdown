Well, it looks like [Qwest has upped its MCI offer to $30 a share, or
$9.7B](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/yhoo/story.asp?source=blq/yhoo&siteid=yhoo&dist=yhoo&guid=%7B5ABB89CF-9041-462C-9BCD-6A898BDCA907%7D).
I hope MCI responds quickly and this fiasco can all be over. I stated my
position on this before so I won't repeat myself.
