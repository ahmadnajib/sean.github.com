[![Nokia
N91](http://www.nokia.com/BaseProject/Sites/NOKIA_MAIN_18022/CDA/Categories/Phones/PhoneModels/_Content/_Static_Files/n91_pm_cs.jpg)](http://www.nokia.com/n91 "Nokia N91")

Nokia has announced their new
[N-series](http://press.nokia.com/PR/200504/991467_5.html) phones. One
in particular, the N91, [stores 3,000
songs](http://news.com.com/Nokia+to+launch+phone+that+stores+3,000+songs/2100-1034_3-5686974.html).
First off, this is a naming change for Nokia since most of their
previous models (except for the N-gage) are designated by four digit
numbers (i.e. 6620, 3650, etc). Since the features of the N91 interest
me the most, I'll focus on that phone.

The N91 has the following interesting features:

-   4GB hard drive
-   WiFi
-   2M pixel camera
-   USB 2.0 sync'ing
-   Stereo-mini jack (for headphones)
-   and it supports Microsoft's WMV, Apple's AAC (sans FairPlay), M4A
    and MP3

All in all a pretty darn sweet phone. They've basically stuffed an iPod
mini into a Nokia phone. And WiFi support? That's amazing, I'm curious
if this means VoIP support or a future firmware upgrade which enables
this. Though with some carriers (\*cough\* Verizon \*cough\*) crippling
Bluetooth, I wonder if the same fate is in store for WiFi. Plus since
this thing is so media/music friendly, it seems that there must be some
sort of iTunes-like store in the works -- though I suspect the carriers
want to run these themselves and capture that additional revenue. Nokia
has also announced partnerships with several top-of-the-line audio
brands to make accessories for this phone
([Sennheiser](http://www.sennheiser.com/) head phones anyone?) I think
the carriers in North America need to wake-up and allow unlimited SMS
messaging and a reasonable amount of data transfer in all of their
plans. Having just got back from Italy, I've seen the difference in how
they use their cell phones from SMS'ing like crazy to paying for items
(mostly vending machines) using their cell phone. If the carriers would
stop nickle-and-diming their customers there are whole revenue streams
which would open up for them as well as third parties (premium SMS
anyone?). Well, it looks like I've strayed from my initial topic, so
I'll end this now. Send me your thoughts on the new phones from Nokia.
