[![Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/images/backpack-small-header-logo.gif)](http://www.backpackit.com/ "Backpack")
[Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/) is finally live and available to
the public. I've already signed up for my free account. As I
[suspected](http://sean.mountcastle.org/?p=3) it is quite a nice
web-based PIM (personal information manager) that works quite well with
email (both sending and receiving) and sends reminders to your mobile.
Though as [Russ has pointed
out](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008449.html) it's not quite
as useful as it could be for mobiles. Still I think that the AJAX
interface is quite slick and it really shows off the power of building
web-apps with [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/).
