[![Agile Web Development with
Rails](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/images/covers/rails_medium.jpg)](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html "Agile Web Development with Rails")
It looks like [DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com) was able to influence
[Dave Thomas](http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi) into
releasing a
[Beta](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html)
version of [Agile Web Development with
Rails](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html). I
purchased the PDF+book edition to show my support and, frankly, I am not
disappointed. Though there are some layout and typographical issues, the
content is great. I feel like I'm finally getting up to speed on
[Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). I'm currently up to Chapter 5,
where the book dives into the development of an e-commerce web-app. I'll
post a review once I finish the book. But, as of right now, I recommend
that anyone interested in developing web-apps with Rails definitely
pick-up a copy.
