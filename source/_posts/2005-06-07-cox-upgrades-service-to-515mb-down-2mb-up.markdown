Good news from my local ISP, [Cox Communications](http://www.cox.com)
will be [boosting their
speeds](http://www.cox.com/fairfax/pressreleases.asp#COX_NORTHERN_VIRGINIA_TO_DRAMATICALLY_BOOST_INTERNET_SPEEDS__AT_NO_ADDITIONAL_CHARGE_TO_CUSTOMERS)
in June.

> CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Preferred package, which is known as the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
> flagship product available across Fairfax County for under $40, will
> soon feature enhanced speeds of up to 5 Mbps per second download and 2
> Mbps upload. The Preferred package is available to bundled customers
> (those who take video or telephone in addition to Internet) for $39.95
> a month. CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Premier package customers will also receive a
> boost in speed. With the new speed enhancement, the service will offer
> customers speeds of up to 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream. The
> Premier package is available to bundled customers at a cost of $54.95

Looks like the competition is heating up while
[Verizon](http://www.verizon.com) is still digging in my front lawn for
