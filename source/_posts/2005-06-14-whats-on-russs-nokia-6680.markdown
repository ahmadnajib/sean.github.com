[Russ](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/) has posted a great piece
entitled [What's on my Nokia
6680](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008503.html). I've been
interested in this phone since I first heard about it several months ago
and it looks like Cingular is finally going to start selling the
[6682](http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/6682/) version shortly. The great
part about Russ's post is the list of all of the applications available
for the Series 60 phones. I wasn't even aware of several of them. Though
my personal favorite is the [Super
GoBoy](http://www.wildpalm.co.uk/SuperGoBoy.html) from
[WildPalm](http://www.wildpalm.co.uk). Being able to play your GBC games
on your phone is just incredible. And playing your old NES games is even
better (using [vNes](http://www.vampent.com/vnes.htm))! If you're
interested in writing games for the Series 60, then the open source
[Frozen Bubble](http://fb-s60.sourceforge.net/) is a great place to
learn from as all of the source code is available at
[SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net/). Take the time to go and read
through Russ's post, there's a bunch of great information there (both
about the 6680 and Series 60 apps in general).
