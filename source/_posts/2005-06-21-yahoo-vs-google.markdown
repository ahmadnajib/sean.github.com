[Tristan Louis](http://www.tnl.net/) has an excellent analysis up on his
site comparing [Yahoo and Google (and Technorati
too)](http://www.tnl.net/blog/entry/Technorati_Yahoo_and_Google_Too).
His findings are quite interesting and mesh with my ad hoc searching for
blogs in both [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) and
[Google](http://www.google.com). I urge you to go to his site and read
his work, but here are the salient points:

> \# Yahoo! generally does a better job at indexing the blogosphere than
> Google does. We know they have been working hard to improve their
> index and here's proof that they are getting results \
>  \# Even if Google is the one with the motto about not doing evil,
> Yahoo! seems to be the one interested in giving equal opportunity to
> the little guy: smaller blogs seem to have a better chance of being
> recognized by Yahoo! than they do of being recognized by Google.

Thus the reason for a higher rank for this unknown blog in Yahoo than in
Google.
