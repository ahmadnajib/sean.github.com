[Broadband Reports](http://www.broadbandreports.com) has an interesting
article up discussing [Next-gen
Broadband](http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/65298). At this
point it looks like [Verizon](http://www.verizon.com) and the cable co's
are in the lead to offer high megabit services (i.e. 100Mbps). In my
neighborhood, the first wave of Verizon contractors has already come
through burying fiber and in response [Cox
Communications](http://www.cox.com) has upgraded my cable modem service
(at no additional cost -- though see my notes below for more). It looks
like Verizon isn't going to actually hook fiber up to my house until I
order their [FiOS](http://www.verizon.com/fios/) service (which I'm not
likely to do until it is either cheaper or considerably faster than my
cable internet service).

Even though Cox claims they have upgraded my service to 5Mbps down/2Mbps
up, I have not noticed any increase in speed, either way. Apparently
they have not upgraded anything and are just putting a new label on the
existing shared 38Mbps. Hopefully now that DOCSIS 3.0 is mostly
finalized, we'll see the equipment hit the streets early next year
(though it would be really nice if [LinkSys](http://www.linksys.com)
figured out a way to upgrade my existing cable modem's firmware instead
of having to fork over more $ for a new box). At any rate, I'm looking
forward to the higher speeds, both downstream and upstream.
