There's a great [interview with Wil
Shipley](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000581.html) at
the [DrunkenBlog](http://www.drunkenblog.com), with a nice treat at the
end (a history of UI design for [Delicious
Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com/)). Wil has his own
[blog](http://wilshipley.com/blog/) which is geared more towards
programmers -- but the interview isn't really about that.

In drunkenbatman's interview with Wil they go into why Wil left (or was
asked to leave) [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/); his
founding of Delicious Monster with [Mike
Matas](http://www.mikematas.com/blog/) (and Mike's decision to leave for
[Apple](http://www.apple.com)); the success of Delicious Library; Wil's
troubles with depression; Cocoa programming; and some great advice for
ISV entrepreneurs. It's definitely worth the time investment to read it.
