I made it to the [O'Reilly Open Source
Convention](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/) in Portland, OR
this evening, registered and picked up my conference materials. It looks
like this year's conference is going to be amazing! I can't wait until
tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have time in the evenings to post about the
day's events.
