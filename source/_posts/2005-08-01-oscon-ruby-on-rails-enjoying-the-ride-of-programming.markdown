[DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com) gave a talk entitled [Ruby on Rails:
Enjoying the Ride of
Programming](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6356)
at OSCON today. He basically went through the creation of a blogging
web-app, the same as he does in the latest [Rails
movie](http://www.rubyonrails.com/show/RailsAcademy). He did embellish
it a bit by adding Ajax support and an RSS feed, but unfortunately much
of the time he was moving so fast it was difficult to keep up. Once he
posts the slides and/or demo code online I'll provide a link to it.
Update Aug 3, 2005: [Phil Windley](http://www.windley.com/) has
[detailed
coverage](http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/08/ruby_on_rails_o.shtml)
of this tutorial. I guess I spent too much time trying to learn Rails
before the tutorial session that I was disappointed that it was so
similar to the latest Rails movie (and when DHH went beyond that he was
having so much fun he sped through validations, Ajax, RSS, etc).
