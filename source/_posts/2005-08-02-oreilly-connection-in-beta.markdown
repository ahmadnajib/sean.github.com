[O'Reilly Connection](http://connection.oreilly.com/) is now in beta.
You can already setup an account and start making contacts (by looking
folks up by their full name after clicking on the "Connect To" link).
It's too early to tell how this will turn out, but so far I like it much
better than [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) and
[Friendster](http://www.friendster.com) (even though it retains much of
the social network feel).
