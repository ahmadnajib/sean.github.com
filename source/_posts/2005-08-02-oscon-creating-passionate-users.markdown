talk on Creating Passionate Users was quite good, unfortunately it was
very visual and involved several group projects (even having the slides
won't do it justice). Thus it is quite difficult for me to sum up. The
key take away is that getting users passionate about your product is
that your product needs to empower the user and fade into the background
(I know, it seems like there's a disconnect). The secret is to get to
the state where your customers have an **"I rule!"** experience -- they
care about how they feel from using your product, not about you or your
company. Her primary example comes from game developers called the
experience spiral. It is a cycle starting with a *compelling benefit*
then there is a (long) period of *activity* with an eventual
*resolution* or *payoff* for the user where they achieve *the next
level* (which involves *new capabilities* and a new set of *compelling
benefits* to drive them on again). Related to this was getting your
users into a state of **flow** where time passes quickly for them
because they are so absorbed by your product. Some of the ways you can
facilitate passion for your product are:

-   Helping users to connect with one another (community), such as
    discussion forums, local user groups, something for advanced users,
    etc.
-   Myths, legends/lore, stories, recognizable people (special users
    and/or the developers), special insider knowledge (community
    jargon), etc.
-   The tribe / Pride items such as t-shirts, bumper stickers, mugs,
    decals -- ways for users to demonstrate that they belong.
-   The wake, allow others to create products or services associated
    with your product (see the iPod effect), such as plug-ins, add-ons,
    training materials, etc.
-   When they want to give you money ... what do you have for them?

Once a link to the slides becomes available, I'll post it here. Much of
this information is available on the [Passionate Users
Blog](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/) and it
looks like Kathy will be coming out with a Creation Passionate Users
book in January 2006. TAGS: OSCON OSCON2005 Passionate Passion
