Jim Weirich gave an interesting presentation on dependency injection
entitled, [Dependency Injection: Vitally Important or Completely
Irrelevant?](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/6473)
Since the slides are available
[online](http://www.onestepback.org/articles/depinj/index.html) and my
wrist is beginning to bother me, I'll sum it up quickly. Is dependency
injection important in a dynamically typed language? No.
