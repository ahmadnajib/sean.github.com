Phillip Torrone, the Associate Editor of Make Magazine, demoed some
great
[Do-It-Yourself](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7456)
items and talked a bit about the recent resurge in the DIY movement. He
showed how to replace the Japanese firmware on the Sony Libre with an
English version -- after that you can download tons of eBooks. He also
passed it around and the resolution is amazing, even in direct light.
Following that he showed how you can use homebrew games as well as a web
browser (from the crappy Wipeout game) on a Sony PSP (as long as you
haven't upgraded the firmware to 2.0). After that he showed us his mouse
bot (as seen in Make magazine) which gets him into trouble with the TSA
each time he travels. Then he showed Linux on the iPod -- it's ability
to record up to 96Khz quality audio and play back video. He also showed
us what he did with this iPod box (made it into a cardboard/foam robot
for kids). The penultimate demo was a powerful green laser which
cooks/burns anything red (he demonstrated by popping red balloons).
Finally, he demo'ed an old rotary phone which he hooked up to a cell
phone (then folks made several phone calls to/from his franken-rotary
phone). I highly recommend subscribing to
[Make](http://www.makezine.com/) -- you won't be disappointed. Update
from PDX's Free WiFi: Phillip Torrone posted

from his "mini-MAKER" fair on Wednesday night at OSCON and I'm in the
video! Well, part of me is, I'm standing to the right of (left of, from
the camera's perspective) and slightly behind the laser so you can see
my khaki pants and red shirt.
