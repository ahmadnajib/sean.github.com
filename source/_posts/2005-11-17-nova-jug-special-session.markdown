[NoVA JUG](http://www.novajug.com:8080/) held a special session on
Thursday night where [Tom Copeland](http://tomcopeland.blogs.com)
presented on [PMD](http://seanmountcastle.com/pmd.sf.net) and [Dave
Thomas](http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi) provided an
introduction to [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org). Held
concurrently was the initial meeting of the NoVA Ruby Users Group -- of
which I hope there will be more meetings. Tom's overview of PMD focused
primarily on CPD, the copy-paste detector. He showed how to run PMD/CPD
and what the results look like (there are a number of plugins for IDEs
to run PMD as well as an ant task). Dave gave a high-level overview of
Rails and showed how quickly you can get webapps up and running using
Rails. He focused on the benefits of Rails from a Java developer's
perspective (since that was the primary audience). He also discussed the
Ruby programming language since many of the attendees were not familiar
with it. Overall, I think he did an excellent job and many folks went
away eager to try out Rails.
