I was having some difficulty with Mac OS X getting my host aliases
working so that I could test using subdomains as account keys under
Rails. In the process I learned quite a bit about
[lookupd](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=30770) and
ended up updating the [Rails
HowTo](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowToUseSubdomainsAsAccountKeys).
