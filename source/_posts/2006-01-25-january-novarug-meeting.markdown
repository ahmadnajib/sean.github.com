Tonight was the second meeting of the Northern VA Ruby Users Group
(NovaRUG) -- the first was held back in
[November](http://seanmountcastle.com/articles/2005/11/17/nova-jug-special-session).

Rich Kilmer spoke about a project he worked on for BBN (who was
contracted by the USAF) to coordinate mid-air refeuling missions written
in Ruby and Flash (using his
[alph](http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/2004/10/alph_code_relea.html)
toolkit).

It was quite interesting to see how Rich went about writing a domain
specific language in Ruby -- basically he worked to understand the
domain really well and began writing his program in this new DSL then he
went back and wrote the Ruby code to parse/eval that DSL. The way Rich
described it sounded amazing, but also intimidating -- I didn't feel
like I could ever do something like that. I wonder if there's a good
resource for learning metaprogramming -- perhaps the [Pragmatic
Programmers](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com) will add such a book to
their Facets of Ruby series.

After that Rich gave a demo of [InfoEther](http://www.infoether.com)'s
new [indi](http://www.getindi.com/) software which resides on a USB key
and embeds everything necessary to run on Windows or Mac OS X (a Ruby
interpreter, Flash 8 Runtime, WebKit, etc). It includes the basic PIM
functionality along with games, IM and an on-line store where you can
purchase more apps/plugins. It looks quite interesting and I'll post
more about it once they start the public beta.

It looks like future NovaRUG meetings will be on Wednesday evenings
(from 7-9pm). And it looks like FGM will continue to host them for the
time being.
