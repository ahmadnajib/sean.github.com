There's a nice article in today's New York Times regarding [Paul
Graham's](http://www.paulgraham.com/) VC firm,
[YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/). You can read it
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/business/businessspecial2/21startup.html?ex=1141189200&en=c1d76164cdf88f86&ei=5070&emc=eta1).
I wish PG had been doing this with YC ten years ago. I've always been
interested in startups and have wanted to found my own company for quite
a long time. Perhaps I'll get the chance yet.
