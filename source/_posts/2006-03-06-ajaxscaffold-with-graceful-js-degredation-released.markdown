[Rich White](http://www.height1percent.com/) has accepted my patch to
add graceful JavaScript degredation to his excellent AjaxScaffold for
Rails. You can read about it
[here](http://www.height1percent.com/articles/2006/03/04/ajaxscaffold-2-2-0-released-with-graceful-js-degredation).
I’m also trying to get drag-and-drop sorting working in the
AjaxScaffold, though I’ve run into some issues. See [Thomas
Fuchs](http://script.aculo.us/)’
[answer](http://wrath.rubyonrails.org/pipermail/rails-spinoffs/2006-March/002986.html)
to my issue.
