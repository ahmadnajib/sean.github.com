I finally got around to purchasing a copy of the [Rails
Recipes](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html)
book by Chad Fowler and I must say I'm enjoying it quite a bit. So I
thought I'd contribute to the discussion surrounding the book with a
recipe: [Quick and Easy
Textfilters](http://fora.pragprog.com/rails-recipes/write-your-own/post/126).
Enjoy!
