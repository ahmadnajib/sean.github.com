I'm a bit late in posting about it (due to extreme busyness at home and
at work), but Devin Mullins gave a nice overview of metaprogramming with
Ruby at the March Northern VA Ruby Users Group meeting. Devin's talk,
entitled "The Tao of Metaprogramming", was more of an exploration of
Ruby's metaprogramming support in an irb session than the standard
PowerPoint/Keynote presentation. He covered the reflection support in
Ruby to see which methods a class responds to as well as how to add
methods dynamically to object instances and classes using
define\_method, instance\_method, class\_eval, method\_missing and eval.
Ostensibly, the talk was subtitled "ActiveRecord's Not Black Magic" but
due to the number of questions/discussion we didn't get into
ActiveRecord that much -- Devin did start to discuss it but I felt that
we only scratched the surface. Overall, I though it was a very good talk
and cleared up some of my questions regarding metaprogramming in Ruby. I
still wish that someone (preferably the [Pragmatic
Programmers](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/)) would publish a book with
a focus on metaprogramming in Ruby and writing domain specific
languages. Why's discussion of writing a DSL in Ruby called [Dwemthyâ€™s
Array](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-6.html#section3) is nice
(and funny), but I'd like to see something deeper. Perhaps, I'm wrong
and it's not enough for a full length book, but I'd be willing to pay
for a [Fridays](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html) type of
short PDF if it were available.
