[Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com/) has graciously accepted one of
my recipes for inclusion in his new book, [Rails
Recipes](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/index.html)! Itâ€™s
recipe \#65, â€œEasy HTML Whitelistsâ€?, in the latest beta version of
the book. If you havenâ€™t already pre-ordered your copy, I suggest you
click over to the Pragmatic Programmers website and do so now. The other
69 recipes are just as good (if not better).
