Tonight was the monthly [NovaRUG](http://www.novarug.org) meeting and
[Brian Sletten](http://www.bosatsu.net) presented on DRb while I
presented on
[RJS](http://www.codyfauser.com/articles/2005/11/20/rails-rjs-templates).
My presentation and code is available
[here](http://seanmountcastle.com/files/rjs-talk.zip). I think it went
over pretty well and I made several new contacts after the meeting which
is always nice. Brianâ€™s presentation is available
[here](http://www.bosatsu.net/talks/DRb.pdf) â€“ so I donâ€™t need to
provide the usual coverage that I do. He gave a very engaging and
amusing talk that everyone enjoyed. One interesting note, not covered in
his slides but played following his presentation, is that a Japanese
band called The Blue Hearts wrote a song called [â€œRinda,
Rindaâ€?](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=102599671&id=102602550&s=143462)
â€“ though it appears to have no relation to the [Rinda
tuplespace](http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/drb/rinda/index.html)
library as the song was first released in 1987.
