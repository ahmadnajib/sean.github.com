This morning I attended [Amy Hoy’s](http://www.slash7.com/) [JavaScript
Boot Camp](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8933)
tutorial. The slides should be available online shortly at Amy’s website
– I’ll update this post once she publishes them. She provided a good
overview of JavaScript as a language, some of the issues with the
various implementations, how to debug it and some of the libraries
available for use. **Updated**: The slides are located
[here](http://www.slash7.com/articles/2006/07/26/javascript-boot-camp-tutorial).
Unfortunately, the material was a little too introductory for me, I
thought she’d spend less time on the JavaScript basics and more on the
intermediate/advanced techniques of the language and libraries. I guess
I misunderstood what I had signed-up for. Anyway, she started out with
the history of the JavaScript language (briefly mentioning the
LiveScript name … which Rich Kilmer quizzed me on at [my RJS
talk](http://seanmountcastle.com/articles/2006/07/20/july-novarug-meeting))
and the ECMAScript process which spawned several different releases of
JavaScript – basically most browsers implement JavaScript 1.5 with the
exception of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) which gives us
JavaScript 1.6. At this point we lost power to everything but the
projector, but Amy took it in stride and continued her presentation. She
went through the syntax of the JavaScript language, keywords, etc. After
getting through the language quirks, she discussed how to use
[FireBug](http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/) and the
[JavaScript shell](http://www.squarefree.com/shell/) to test and debug
your JavaScript code. Some of the libraries which were mentioned
include: [JSON](http://www.json.org), [MochiKit](http://mochikit.com/),
[Script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/),
[moo.fx](http://moofx.mad4milk.net/),
[Behavior](http://bennolan.com/behaviour/), and
[Prototype](http://prototype.conio.net/). When asked for her favorite
JavaScript related sites she gave her top three:

-   [QuirksMode](http://www.quirksmode.org/)
-   [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/)
-   [Ajaxian](http://www.ajaxian.com/)
