This morning I attended [Stuart
Halloway’s](http://www.relevancellc.com/) [Ajax on
Rails](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8520)
tutorial. The slides from his presentation are available
[here](http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ruby/rails/ajax_rails),
[here](http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ruby/rails/rjs) and
[here](http://www.codecite.com/presentation/ajax/prototype). This was
the first time I’d attended one of Stuart’s presentations and I was
impressed by his relaxed presentation style. He also seems to be a
genuinely nice fellow – during the break, I spoke briefly with him to
see if he would be interested in speaking about
[Streamlined](http://streamlined.relevancellc.com) to the [NoVA
RUG](http://www.novarug.org). Stuart started off by asking us what the
really successful (and big) companies of the past few years have in
common – the answer was their use of open source. Yahoo!, Google,
Amazon, etc didn’t go out and purchase an enterprise solution from
Microsoft or Sun, they built it themselves using freely available open
source tools. So he positioned Ruby on Rails and Ajax as enablers to
help you build the next great company. After a brief introduction to
Prototype, Stuart went into several examples using Ajax with Rails: Ajax
Search, Degradable Ajax, Autocomplete, and Drag and Drop. After that he
went into RJS discussing RJS templates, inline RJS, detecting AJAX on
the server-side, element and collection proxies, and testing RJS using
[ARTS](http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/29/guide-test-driven-rjs-with-arts).
He also gave a brief demo of
[Streamlined](http://streamlined.relevancellc.com), which he’ll expand
upon at his session tomorrow. Finally, he wrapped up with a look at
Prototype and it’s spin on JavaScript – making it friendly for Ruby
developers. He’ll cover more on Prototype in his session tomorrow.
