Tonight the opening keynotes for OSCON were held. After the
[Google/O’Reilly Open Source
Awards](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9521),
Larry Wall gave his annual [State of the
Onion](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9540) in
which he talked about his other ‘child’, Perl, and how she’s growing
into adulthood (Perl will be 20 years old this year). After Larry, the
[White Camel
Awards](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9541)
were given out.

Next up was [Kathy Sierra](http://headrush.typepad.com/) – usually Paul
Graham speaks on opening night but this year they decided to switch it
up. She gave a talk entitled [Cognitive
Seduction](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9542)
which covered her usual Passionate Users content (the presentation was
quite good, I can’t really do it justice here).

Finally, [Damian
Conway](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_spkr/24) read
from his latest work, [The DaVinci
Codebase](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9414).
It was a very funny spoof on The DaVinci Code regarding the threat of
Opus Arai (RIAA). The video he played at the end is linked below.
