Now that [OSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/) is over, I
like to make an attempt at distilling my thoughts on the conference.
Last year I wrote a lengthy
[post](http://seanmountcastle.com/articles/2005/08/07/oscon-observations)
on my observations; this year it’s going to be short. I was a bit
disappointed by this year’s OSCON – not that I didn’t have a good time
and learn a bit – but the mood seemed more subdued, there wasn’t the
excitement that was felt last year. In fact, many of the attendees I
spoke to in the halls felt the difference too and several said that this
would be their last OSCON. I can’t pin it down to a single change in the
conference – in fact, prior to the conference I had expected it to be
even better than last year as I had so many conflicting sessions that I
wanted to attend. The absence of [Paul
Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) at the Tuesday night keynotes was
disappointing but [Kathy Sierra](http://headrush.typepad.com/) gave an
excellent talk. The quality of speakers was roughly the same as last
year and the topics were similar (lots of Perl, Python, Ruby, Ajax,
etc). The variety of keynotes was good, though last year I left many of
the keynotes feeling inspired and excited, this year I really didn’t
feel that. So on the surface, this year’s OSCON should’ve been just as
good as last year’s – but in some intangible way it wasn’t – if I didn’t
receive agreement on this from others, I would simply chock it up to my
imagination or melancholy. So 2006 might be the last year I attend OSCON
as well … I guess we’ll see what happens next year.
