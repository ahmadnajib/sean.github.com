Well, I finally decided to dump [Typo](http://www.typosphere.org). I was
headed for [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com) as I've been hacking on
it quite a bit recently. But I decided that I may post more frequently
if I didn't start playing with the source code to my blog everytime I
want to post. Thus I've switched back to WordPress which originally
powered this site (when it was known as
[sean.mountcastle.org](http://sean.mountcastle.org)). I'll post shortly
about why my blog was 'down for maintenance' for the past month and I'll
also be working to get the old posts from Typo imported here.
