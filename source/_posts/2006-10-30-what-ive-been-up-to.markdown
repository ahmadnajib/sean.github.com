In an earlier post I mentioned that I had to place this blog offline for
a bit. That was because I was looking for a job and any company that I'd
want to work for would be savvy enough to
[google](http://www.google.com) me and find this blog. Thus I didn't
want my previous writings interfering with my job search. I had what I
believe is an excellent process for my job search which I'd like to
detail in another post, in fact there are many things I want to post
about related to my short break. I also took the [Sean & JoEllen
Mountcastle Foundation](http://mountcastle.org) and
[Pyralid](http://www.pyralid.com) offline temporarily too. In the case
of Pyralid, I stopped the consulting work when I accepted my new job
(though the two products/services under development have been handed off
to my business partner). Here are several of the topics I need to blog
about soon:

-   my job search process
-   tips for landing your dream job
-   the list of local
    [start-ups](http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/11/22/startups-in-northern-va/)
-   local [qualified
    investors](http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/11/15/qualified-investors-in-northern-va/)
-   local [companies working with
    Ruby](http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/11/22/startups-in-northern-va/)
-   my [interview with Electronic
    Arts](http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/12/10/interviewing-at-ea-mythic/)
-   my consulting experience (with Pyralid)
-   my product/service development experience (with Pyralid)
-   my side-project to build a game using Ruby on Rails
