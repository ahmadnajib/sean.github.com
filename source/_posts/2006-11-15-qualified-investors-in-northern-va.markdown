I know, I know--this post has a really lame title. I had wanted to call
it VC's which actively invest in the DC metro area but I've included
angels in this list as well. I've tried to be as thorough as possible,
but this research was done several months ago when I was looking for a
new job and desperately wanted to work at a startup. Unfortunately, I
was not willing to relocate and the number of startups in Northern VA
whose domains overlap with my interests and skills is rather low. So,
without any further ado, here's the list in no particular order:

If you know of any more VCs/Angels in our area, please leave comments.
Also if you have opinions on any of these VCs, I'd be interested to hear
those as well. I've only dealt indirectly with two of the VCs from this
list.
