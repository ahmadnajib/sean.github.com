Paul Graham has an interesting piece up at Y Combinator entitled [The
Top Internet VC Firms](http://ycombinator.com/topvcs.html). This
provides a bit more insight into some of the VC's I mentioned in my
[previous
post](http://seanmountcastle.com/2006/11/15/qualified-investors-in-northern-va/)
(many are definitely **not** top tier VCs--though I think this was
obvious before).
