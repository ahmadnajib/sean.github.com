I compiled this list several months ago when I was looking for work. In
the end, I decided to join an established company. I did not get a
chance to interview with each of the companies in the attached
spreadsheet, but I'll write separate posts about the ones that I did get
a chance to speak with. As a little bonus, here are the companies that I
know of in Northern Virginia working with the
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language. Note that not all
of them are startups in the traditional sense:

-   InfoEther ([www.infoether.com](http://www.infoether.com)): This is
    [Rich Kilmer's](http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/) current startup
    providing a secure and mobile digital vault on a USB drive. [Tom
    Copeland](http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/) also works at InfoEther.
-   CustomInk ([www.customink.com](http://www.customink.com)): They have
    an innovative web app for desigining logos, etc that can then be
    printed on shirts, mugs, golf balls, pens, etc. They are currently
    hiring.
-   Bosatsu Consulting ([www.bosatsu.net](http://www.bosatsu.net/)):
    Brian is working on some Ruby (non-Rails) projects and was looking
    for someone to assist with Rails work--I don't know if he's found
    anyone yet.
-   Digital Focus ([www.digitalfocus.com](http://www.digitalfocus.com)):
    This is a consulting company, primarily focusing on Agile
    development (training, team insertion, etc). They are looking for
    Ruby developers as the majority of their consultants are J2EE and
    .Net folks.
-   Revolution Health Group
    ([www.revolution.com](http://www.revolution.com/health/default.asp)):
    The Revolution suite of companies was founded in Washington, DC by
    Steve Case (of AOL fame). The team at RHG is looking to tie together
    several different healthcare acquisitions into a Ruby on Rails
    portal. They've been trying to hire Ruby developers for quite awhile
    now.

If you know of any more companies with a focus on Ruby in the DC metro
area, please let me know about it via the comments. Here's the link to
the Excel spreadsheet containing the list of startups I found nearby. I
know for a fact that a few of the companies listed have already been
acquired. [Startups in Northern
