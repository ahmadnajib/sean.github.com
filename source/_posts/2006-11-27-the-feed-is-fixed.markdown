I should never try to make major changes to anything right before a
holiday because it will most definitely break. So when I switched over
to [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) last Wednesday, I completely
broke the feeds to my blog. [Luis de la
Rosa](http://www.luisdelarosa.com/), a fellow Mac and Ruby/Rails
developer in the Washington, DC metro area (who is also an entrepreneur,
see [Happy Apps, LLC](http://www.happyapps.com)), notified me of the
issue but I wasn't able to login and resolve it until this morning. So
the feed should be working fine now (through FeedBurner, so I can track
my readership). Please let me know via the comments if there are still
any problems.
