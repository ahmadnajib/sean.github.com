Last night I participated in a "code fest" sponsored by my employer. It
was great fun and the code fest was powered by
[TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com). This was my first time
participating in any sort of coding competition and while I didn't make
the top three, I did place in the top ten. I'm definitely looking
forward to the next company sponsored event in February. For those of
you not familiar with TopCoder, they basically provide a Java
application/applet called the Competition Arena. Once you login to the
arena, you can then register for a Single Round Match (SRM, in TopCoder
parlance), but only during the registration window (which appears to be
two hours prior to the event). Once the event begins you have 75 minutes
to solve problems of increasing difficulty. Each problem set is assigned
a certain number of points (usually 250, 500 and 1000). You are judged
both on the correctness of your program as well as the time it took you
to develop and test it. Since you must develop, compile and test your
code in TopCoder's arena Java app you can only write your solution in
C++, Java, C\#, or VisualBasic. I wish they offered Ruby as an option
(or even Python), but at this time you're stuck with those four choices.
You are allowed to choose your programming language at the problem set
level (i.e. you don't need to stick with the same language for all
three). Since the majority of my experience in the past ten years has
been with Java I selected that for all three of the problem sets. In
retrospect, I might've fared better had I chosen C++ as that is what
I've been using almost exclusively at work these past three months. I
also need to manage my time better as I ran out of time just before I
was going to submit my solution to the 1000 point problem--I believe
that had I finished in time, I would've placed in the top three (I guess
we'll see when I participate in February). Once the content ends, you're
able to look at the solutions from the other participants and can
challenge their solutions if you believe you've found a bug. If your
challenge succeeds, you earn points and the person challenged loses all
of the points for that problem, but if your challenge fails, you'll lose
points and the person challenged will gain points. There were a few
successful and unsuccessful challenges during the competition. Looking
through people's code it was clear that the folks who had participated
previously didn't bother indenting their code properly or ensuring it
was clear--they focused on getting it working in the shortest time
possible. I made the newbie mistake of properly indenting my code and
even writing psudocode comments as an outline prior to writing the real
code (next time I'll do this on paper if necessary). I also was hampered
slightly by the Arena editor as it uses the MS Windows keybindings even
on the Mac! Thus CTRL+C is copy instead of CMD+C -- I kept hitting the
Apple shortcuts instead of their Windows counterparts and this slowed me
down as well. My colleague suggested just keeping Emacs open and copy
and paste as necessary into the Arena editor. Unfortunately, I cannot
post the problem sets here as they are copyrighted by TopCoder and you
must have permission to republish them. But if you go to the TopCoder
site, you can see many example problems. If you're interested in
petitioning TopCoder to offer Ruby as an alternative language for
competitions, I urge you to [email them](mailto:service@topcoder.com),
as I have. **Update 2006-12-21**: I received the following response from
TopCoder and have asked them to add Ruby as an option for "Marathon
Matches"

> We do not allow interpreted languages like Python or Ruby in our

> playing field impossible. We do offer Python as a fully supported
> language choice in our Marathon Match events, where we can relax the
> constraints because of the non time-critical nature of the event.Â You
