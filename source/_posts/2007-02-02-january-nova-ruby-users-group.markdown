Unfortunately I was on vacation when the last NoVA RUG was held in
January. Thankfully [Luis](http://www.luisdelarosa.com) has taken the
time to place [his notes
online](http://www.luisdelarosa.com/2007/01/25/northern-virginia-ruby-users-group-january-2007-notes/).
For the [February
meeting](http://www.novarug.org/articles/2007/01/24/february-meeting)
we'll have [Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com/) as guest speaker.
