I've been meaning to write about [The Venture
Bros.](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/venturebros/) since I found out
about them over lunch during my interview at EA Mythic. I think that the
series is quite funny and have been enjoying it ever since I first heard
about it. Though I have seen reviews on the 'net which complain that the
show is infantile, others compare it to *South Park* and *The Simpsons*
as well as *Johnny Quest*. The last comparison is apt as that is where
Venture Brothers draws its inspiration, though all aspects of popular
culture are referenced in the shows. My personal favorite episode thus
far is [Twenty Years to
Midnight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Years_to_Midnight).
