I've been looking for a good introductory book on
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) for quite awhile now. Unfortunately,
the Concurrent Programming in Erlang book just doesn't do it for me
(plus only the first part is available online). Thankfully, it looks
like the [Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/) have
come through with [Programming
Erlang](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html).
