You know how you go to a conference and most of the smart, interesting
folks are using [Apple](http://www.apple.com/hardware/) hardware? I've
been noticing a trend among my colleagues at work and those whom I've
met at user groups and conferences--the very same folks who are at the
top of their game developing software also drive
[Acuras](http://www.acura.com/). Coincidence? **Disclaimer:** Yes, I
drive a 2004 Acura TL and one reason (out of many) that I bought the car
was for the technology (bluetooth hands-free-link, for example). Though
I'm not conceited enough to consider myself a kick-ass software
engineer.
