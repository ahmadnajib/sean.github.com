Tonight we had the March meeting of the Northern VA Ruby Users Group.
First up was Douglas Sellers who talked about
[Selenium](http://www.openqa.org/selenium/) and [Selenium on
Rails](http://www.openqa.org/selenium-on-rails). After a short break, I
spoke about RESTful Rails (focusing on CRUD, REST and ActiveResource).

Doug provided us with an excellent overview of Selenium core and went in
to how to install and configure it (hint: it's as simple as downloading
and unzipping it into your public web root directory). He then went into
the steps involved in manually creating tests and test suites and how it
gets tedious very quickly (as you're writing HTML tables). To make the
development tester's job much easier he walked through the same test
using Selenium on Rails which allows you to use Ruby to generate your
tests. Doug's slides are available
[here](http://novarug.org/douglas_sellers_selenium_presentation.ppt). I
ended up rushing through my slides and didn't enunciate well so the
listener experience was pretty bad, I'm sure. I need to relax when
presenting and slow down. Still, I think that the content stands on its
own and many folks seemed interested in my sample application for
managing users groups. You can download the PDF-ized slides
[here](http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/restful-rails.pdf)
and once I get the subversion repository setup, you'll be able to view
and checkout the source code
[here](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rugomatic/). Also, here are the two
scripts I followed for the demo:
[REST](http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/rest-script.txt)
and
[ActiveResource](http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/ares-script.txt).
