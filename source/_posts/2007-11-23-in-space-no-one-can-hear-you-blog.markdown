My how time has flown. It's been four months and a day since I last
blogged and I need to get back to it. By now I've probably lost all of
my subscribers and
[NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/) doesn't
even recognize it as a dinosaur (I guess that means my blog's turned
into oil -- yay for me with it nearing $100/barrel). I have several
unfinished posts stuck here in WordPress and several more rattling
around in my head. For those of you who are still hanging around, here
are some of the topics:

-   [The Advanced Ruby Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby/) (I
    attended this back in July).
-   How to distribute your Ruby app without giving away your source
    code.
-   Performance tuning a networking application (in C).
-   Developing for mobile phones (specifically the
    [iPhone](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/devcenter/) and Google's
    [Android](http://code.google.com/android/)).
-   Game programming in Ruby (with and without Rails).
-   Interviewing technical candidates.
-   Startups.
-   Book reviews.
