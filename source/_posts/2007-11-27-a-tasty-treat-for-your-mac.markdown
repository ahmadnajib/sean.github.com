The folks over at [Aquafadas](http://www.aquafadas.com/) are running a
promotion entitled, "[Give Good Food to Your
Mac.](http://givegoodfoodtoyourmac.com/)" It's a very sweet deal as you
get to choose from 28 different Mac OS X apps and the more you purchase
the bigger the discount. If you purchase three apps, you get a 30%
discount, 40% for five, 50% for seven and 70% for ten.

Here's a little hint, pick the five apps you really want (even if they
are the most expensive apps available). This will start you off with a
40% discount for the apps you want. Then pick the two cheapest apps --
once this brings your discount up to 50%, the total will probably be
less than it was without those two apps (unless you've only been
choosing the cheapest apps). Finally, pick the next three cheapest apps
-- you should end up with ten apps for a total cost which was less than
price of your original five! You're getting the five apps you want, plus
another five free and then they'll throw in another app at check out
(for me it was [Postino](http://www.coladia.com/postino/), a feed reader
-- I'm not sure if they give the same bonus app away to everyone or
not).

This great deal is time limited and ends on December 9th, so get on over
[there](http://www.givegoodfood2yourmac.com/kitchen34/index.php) and
scoop up some great Mac apps.
