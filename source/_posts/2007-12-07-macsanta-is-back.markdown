[MacSanta](http://www.macsantadeals.com/) is back again this year with
some nice savings on great software for Mac OS X! Each day they have 20%
off deals on a subset of the software in their extended list (which is
all 10% off until December 24th). Just use the coupon code,
**MACSANTA07**, at participating vendors.

Hurry over and scoop up those apps which you've always wanted! So far,
I've purchased [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) and
[Webnote Happy](http://www.happyapps.com/webnotehappy/).
