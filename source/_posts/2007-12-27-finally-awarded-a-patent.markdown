After almost seven years, I was finally awarded a patent:
[**7,170,862**](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,170,862.PN.&OS=PN/7,170,862&RS=PN/7,170,862 "Partitioning a network element into multiple virtual network elements").
It's assigned to my previous employer, [Cisco Systems,
Inc](http://cisco.com/). Until I started this process, I never imagined
how long the [USP&TO](http://www.uspto.gov/index.html) could take to
finally assign a patent. Now I'm waiting to see if any of my other
patents filed by Cisco will be awarded.

This actually happened back in January, but since I was never notified,
I researched it myself after the recent news of Cisco opening up IOS to
3rd party developers.
