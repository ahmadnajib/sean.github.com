Whether you realize it or not, there are several companies gathering a
tremendous amount of data about you. One such company is
[Acxiom](http://www.acxiom.com/) which maintains consumer information on
nearly every household in the U.S. (and has branched out to other
countries). Acxiom combines tax records and public census data with
transactional data from its clients (the corporations you deal with on a
daily basis). Using this data, Acxiom has created a product called
[PersonicX](http://www.acxiom.com/default.aspx?ID=1766&DisplayID=18)
which is a finely-grained household level segmentation system based on
consumer and demographic characteristics.

The idea of such a classification system both interests and appalls me
quite a bit, so I've done some research into the 70 segments and 21
life-stage groups.

Even though this data is proprietary, I've found the following
information through publicly available sources (ordered by cluster
number):

1.  **Summit Estates**: The wealthiest of all the clusters. In every
    sense, these families are enjoying the good life--luxury travel,
    entertainment and consumption of every kind are within easy reach.
    Middle-aged (36-56). (*Group 11B - Boomer Barons*)
2.  **Established Elite**: Late middle-aged (46-65) married home owners
    with no children living with them. They are wealthy and live in
    suburban and urban locations. (*Group 15M - Mature Wealth*)
3.  **Corporate Clout**: This exceedingly well educated group defines
    themselves as workaholics. Savvy investors who like to read Forbes
    and travel magazines, they are also heavy users of air travel and
    corporate credit cards. (*Group 15M - Mature Wealth*)
4.  **Skyboxes & Suburbans**: One of the best-educated and wealthiest
    clusters. They shop at upscale stores, spend time feathering their
    nest and adhere to regular fitness programs. Middle-aged (36-55).
    (*Group 11B - Boomer Barons*)
5.  **Sitting Pretty**: Late middle-aged (46-65), married home owners
    with no children in the home. They are wealthy, living in the
    outer-suburbs and towns. (*Group 19M - Golden Years*)
6.  **Shooting Stars**: Still relatively young at a mean age of 36, and
    with top rankings for income, college education, home value and net
    worth, these consumers have the world by the tail. (*Group 7X - Cash
    & Careers*)

Some the cluster identifiers are funny while others are pretty
disheartening--I'm sure the intention was to make them memorable and in
that Acxiom has succeeded. You'll notice that the majority of
information available online focuses on the top thirty or so segments,
as these are apparently the most lucrative (consisting of the upper and
upper-middle classes).

It's amazing how much data Acxiom collects and the detail of information
they can extract from that data. For instance, for each segment they can
give you an idea of what activities they enjoy, their opinions/beliefs,
how they vote, where they shop, what they read, what they eat, what
their finances look like, etc.

Acxiom provides [a
document](http://www.acxiom.com/subimages/4192004105508preemptive_mktg_wp.pdf)
on their website which shows how they can predict the migration of
consumers from one segment to the next. They need to predict well as
these segments are so specific that nearly one-third of Americans change
their segment each year.

If you can help me find more freely-available, detailed information
(like
[this](http://www.acxiom.com/subimages/1126200385918taking_hold_group_2y.pdf))
for any of these segments, please leave a comment below or email me.
