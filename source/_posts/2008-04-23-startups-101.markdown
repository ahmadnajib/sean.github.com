[![Refresh
DC](http://seanmountcastle.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/refreshdc.png)](http://refresh-dc.org/)

Tonight I had the opportunity to attend a special [Refresh
DC](http://refresh-dc.org/) meeting on the challenges of starting your
own business. The format was a panel of folks from the DC startup scene
moderated by [Jackson
Wilkinson](http://www.viget.com/about/team/jwilkinson) of [Viget
Labs](http://www.viget.com). The panel consisted of [Brian
Williams](http://www.viget.com/about/team/bwilliams) of Viget Labs,
[Andrew Lee](http://andrewlee.com/) of [Publi.us](http://publi.us/),
Eric Rupert from [Odeo](http://odeo.com/), [Eddie
Frederick](http://blog.hungrymachine.com/)of [Hungry
Machine](http://hungrymachine.com/), and [Sean
Greene](http://www.launchboxdigital.com/blog.html) of [LaunchBox
Digital](http://www.launchboxdigital.com/).

These were the main points I took away:

1.  **Be passionate.** The most important quality for startup founders
    is to be passionate about their product or service. Starting a
    company can be exhilarating but the setbacks can be really
    difficult. If you're not passionate about what you're doing each of
    these roadblocks will be an excuse for you to quit. Figure out what
    you're passionate about and work on that.
2.  **Focus on your product.** Don't focus on the pie-in-the-sky
    potential valuations of your company or worry about leasing office
    space, hiring an attorney, finding an accountant, etc. Instead you
    should focus on the product or service you're going to sell. Get
    something out there quickly -- pick the most important feature and
    get it out there in front of your customers quickly.
3.  **Have your customers influence your product.** If you follow the
    previous advice and get your product out there quickly you can use
    customer feedback to iterate your product. You may not know all of
    the difference ways customers will use your product, so this
    feedback is critical in charting your product roadmap.
4.  **Equity is control, don't surrender it easily.** One of the
    attendees asked about using equity to pay for services if money was
    tight. Brian said to avoid giving out equity as you make that person
    a partner in your business. While they may not have a controlling
    interest, they are still an owner and have some influence.
5.  **Don't overfund.** All of the panelists warned of the dangers of
    taking too much money as it does more than dilute the founders'
    ownership. Venture capitalists are looking to make a large return o
    their capital for themselves and their limited partners. If you need
    to pay a vendor or contractor find another way -- defer payment, use
    credit, etc.
6.  **Hire slow, fire fast.** Early employees can make or break your
    company. You will be working long hours aside these folks so you
    must ensure they're a good fit. If you make a bad hire, you need to
    resolve the situation quickly, don't let emotion get in the way.

Some of the books recommended were: [Art of the
Start](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting/dp/1591840562/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1209008603&sr=8-1),
[Getting to
Yes](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1209008634&sr=8-2),
and [Founders at
Work](http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1590597141/ref=pd_bbs_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1209008603&sr=8-3).
Andrew also recommended [Startup School](http://startupschool.org/) run
by [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) (YC). I've been reading [Paul
Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com)'s essays for around seven years now
and following YC's investments. I'm glad to see an early stage investor
like YC in the DC area (LaunchBox Digital) and hope that the startup
scene in DC and suburbs becomes more vibrant.

Thanks to [Strategic Analysis](http://www.sainc.com/) for hosting this.
It was a great venue and hope they'll offer to host Refresh DC again.
