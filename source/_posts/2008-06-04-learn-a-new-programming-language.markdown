As [Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com/) says, "The best reason to
learn a new programming language is to learn to think differently." Here
in Northern VA, we have a new opportunity to think differently with the
introduction of the [NoVA Languages
group](http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages). [Chris
Williams](http://www.twitter.com/voodootikigod) from [Iterative
Designs](http://www.iterativedesigns.com/) posted to the [NoVA
RUG](http://novarug.org/) mailing list this morning and received quite a
bit of interest. Here's what he has to say about the new group:

> Thoughts on the makeup of the group include obtaining (however you
> want) a book, working through the book 1 chapter per week on one night
> of that week with a group of like minded individuals.

To start, the group will work through Joe Armstrong's [Programming
Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang) book
starting on Monday, June 16th (hopefully I'll be able to work out a
schedule with my wife so I can attend). This is an excellent choice on
several levels: every developer should know a functional programming
language; single core processors are increasingly rare and the number of
cores in commodity hardware should only increase in the coming years;
and I already own the book.

If [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) doesn't pique your interest, the
[NSCoderNight DC](http://groups.google.com/group/nscodernightdc) group
is going to work through the 3rd Edition of [Aaron
Hillegass's](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) [Cocoa Programming for Mac OS
X](http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619)
book on Tuesday nights. For several months now, I've been playing around
with Cocoa and while I'm getting used to the syntax of Objective-C, the
XCode IDE and Interface Builder still seem foreign to me (I never liked
IDEs having been weened on Emacs).

It's a great time to be a programmer in Northern Virginia!

**Update:** It turns out that there's another Cocoa group right around
the corner from me in Reston:
[CocoaHeads](http://www.cocoaheads.org/us/RestonVirginia/index.html).
They meet the second Thursday of each month.
