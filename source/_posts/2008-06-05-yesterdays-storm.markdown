[ErinGary](http://xiix.wordpress.com/) has [NEXRAD images and commentary
of yesterday's storm](http://eringary.com/storm/) here in Northern, VA.
For about half-an-hour yestersay, the folks at work milled around in
interior offices, hallways, and the stairwell while my family at home
hid out in the basement. Thankfully there were not much damage in my
neighborhood, though I saw several fallen trees on homes during my
commute home.
