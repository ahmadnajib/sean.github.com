reports that a company called [MyGallons](http://mygallons.com/) allows
folks to pre-purchase gallons of gasoline at a predetermined average
price for the area where they live. According to the article, the
gallons are loaded onto a debit card that the company says is accepted
at more than 95% of the nation's fueling stations. To take part in their
service, MyGallons charges an annual fee starting at $29.95.

It seems like an interesting service to help defray higher energy
prices.
