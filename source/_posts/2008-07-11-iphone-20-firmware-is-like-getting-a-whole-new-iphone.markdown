After bricking my iPhone this morning by getting caught in the iTunes
server onslaught, I was able to complete the upgrade successfully this
evening. The upgrade breathes new life into the EDGE iPhone -- when I'm
on a WiFi network it's almost equivalent to the iPhone 3G. So far I've
downloaded twelve free apps from the [App
Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=285119007&id=25204&mt=8)
and paid for one (Bejeweled 2). Even though I balked at paying $9.99 for
an iPhone game, my friend [Dave](http://blacka.com/david/) convinced me
that 1) it's a reasonable price and 2) it's a small price to pay for
something that I'll use nearly every day. I can already tell that care
must be taken with the lure of the App Store lest I go broke.

In related news, I finally received approval from Apple for my [iPhone
developer cert](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/), so now I
can try out my audio application on my iPhone and potentially sell it
via the App Store.
