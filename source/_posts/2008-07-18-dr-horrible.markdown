NPR's [All Things Considered](http://wamu.org/programs/atc/) had a [nice
story](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92678153) on
[Dr. Horrible](http://drhorrible.com/) tonight. This enjoyable,
currently web-only, musical was produced during the writers' strike last
year by Joss Whedon. I highly recommend catching it while you still can.
