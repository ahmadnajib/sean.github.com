This past weekend, [Luis de la Rosa](http://www.luisdelarosa.com/) and I ran [iOSDevCamp DC 2012](http://iosdevcampdc.com/), hosted by [Verisign](http://www.verisigninc.com/). This year our sponsors were: [Savvy Apps](http://getappsavvy.com/), [Millenial Media](http://mmedia.com/), [Verisign](http://www.verisigninc.com), and [Happy Apps](http://happyapps.com/). All of the talks were very well received and it was a great opportunity to network with other iOS developers in the mid-Atlantic region. For those talks where the slides were made available, I've linked to them below. I'll come back and update this post as more slides become available.
