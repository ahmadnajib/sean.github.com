I'm currently a Senior Manager of Software Engineering at a company which 
operates the intelligent infrastructure used to enable and protect billions of 
interactions every day across the Internet. I will refrain from blogging about 
my employer. From the posts, you can see that I'm interested in software 
development. Businesses in general, and start ups in particular, are of great 
interest to me. As I tend to read quite a few business books, I may end up 
blogging about that too. If you need to reach me, you can email me at
[smountcastle@gmail.com](mailto:smountcastle@gmail.com).
