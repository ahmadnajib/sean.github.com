I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at a company which operates the
intelligent infrastructure that enables and protects billions of
interactions every day across the world's voice and data networks. I
will refrain from blogging about my employer. From the posts, you can
see that I'm interested in software development. Businesses in general, and
start ups in particular, are of great interest to me. As I tend to read
quite a few business books, I may end up blogging about that too. If you
need to reach me, you can email me at
[smountcastle@gmail.com](mailto:smountcastle@gmail.com).
